(¹) The following letter accompanied this commission :—

“ Desa Sia—Being desirous of giving the utmost efficiency to the office of htau rural, which
1 find to have been of very early institution in the diocese of Sarum, 1 have caused the inclosed
commission to be drawn up and transmitted to those clergymen who have· been appointed to the
office since its revival in this see.

‘¹ The powers which the instrument conveys to you, under my seal and signatura, are more
extensive than have been entrusted to the 'ozans of this diocese since the days of Bishop Ward ;
but under the pressure of declining years, 1 am glad to avail myself of the fullest licence of
delegation, which the usage of this see 111 8811181 days, and the forms of existing prelates else-
where, appear to sanction.

“The additional matters, to which your attention is directed by the enlarged commission, are
taken from ancient instruments of my own diocese, and from modern ones of the dioceses of
Canterbury, Londnn, winchester, Lincoln, and Worcester.

‘⁴ The articles of inquiry have been newly arranged, and adapted to the improved commission.
They need not be returned to the palace till the ensuing summer.

‘⁴ The seal, which 1 have the pleasure of presenting ω you¹ you will use for the official purposes

referred to in the commission.
“ 1 am, 11881· Sir, yours very faithfully,

‘⁴ December 18, 1835. “ Τ. SARUM.”
