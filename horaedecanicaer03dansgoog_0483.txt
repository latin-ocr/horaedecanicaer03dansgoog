with that report, Ι shall author-ize the tuta! bean to receive the declaratione, witness
the subscriptions, and administer the oaths by law required to be made and taken,
and in my name to license him to the cure. And if any person shall presume to
officiate as a curate in any part of my diocese after the lst of October, without
having obtained my licence, or without having gone before the tutal Imm in order to
obtain it, I shall institute a process in my court against every person so offending.”—
pp. 129, 130. The office is again referred to in pp. 141 and 152.

There are, at present, eight tura! braum who receive their appointment from the
bishop; but no particular form or instrument is used on the occasion. The British
Mayazine for Sept. uncoexxxrv. (p. 357) bears testimony to the utility of the office,
as a part of the machinery of a diocesan society for promoting the building and
enlargement of churches and chapels within the diocese of St. Asaph.
