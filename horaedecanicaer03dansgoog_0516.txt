(¹) This is a very important item of inquiry, and pleads some antiquity for its introduction. In
the synodal constitutions of Sodor and Mann AD. mccxcl. we find this injunction :—-“ Habeat
archidiaconus omnia ornamenta ecclesiarum in scriptis redacta, et utendh'a aarum, vestes et libros,
et sinyulis annis suo conspectui easaon'ae presentari, ut videat, qua adjecta suerint per diligentiam
parochianorum, vel quae medio tempore per neyliyentiam vel malitiam vicariorum deperdita, vel
per incuriam eorum aliquo modo diminuta, quid per clericos, quid per Ιαίοω.” CC. M. B. ee H.
Vol. 11. p. 179.
