and Wilford.

Within this extensive diocese there were, at the date of my last publication, no
tuta! beans: but it had been suggested by Mr. Kitson (Ecclesiastical Courts’ Reporb
mcccxxxn. p. 222), that the exercise of archidiaconal authority might be rendered
more easy and effectual by their appointment in the larger archdeaconries, and par·
ticularly in those of the county of Norfolk—-the local situation of which is incon-
venient. Still, the authority of the archdeacons was effectively exercised mere, by
regular parochial visitations, at that time3 each parish being visited once in three
years. Neglect, however, there must have been in times past z—Tloe Diocesan
Ratun-m from Enqland and Wales, for the year uncccxxxl.. present us with no loes
than two hundred and eighty-three clergymen of this diocese, who are non-resident
oh their cures, on account of the want or urfitness of personage—homa,- and with
four dilapidated churches z—which assuredly indicates neglect of parochia] visitation
in past days, however regularly that useful branch of discipline may have been sup-
ported by existing functionaries.

I have much satisfaction in noticing that the office of tuta! beau was revived
throughout this· diocese, A.D. uncccxnu„ two beans being appointed, with a few ex·
ceptione, to each henum: and Mr. Canon Wodehouse, to whom I am indebted, at the
lord bishop’s solicitation, sor the Instruments then used, informs me. that ‘⁴ the Insti-
tution promises to ensure many ecclesiastical improvements, some of which indeed
1 have been already realized.''

The constitution of the betuna! office was heretofore in this diocese of a peculiar
character, and certainly of great antiquity. The tuta! Beauss appear to have been
forty·five in number, at their full zenith ;—-twelve belonging to the archdeaconry of
Norwich, twelve to that of Norfolk, thirteen to that of Suffolk, and eight to that of
Sudbury. All of them were collated by the bishop, and enjoyed their hamt& for
their natural lives. The institution—books of the see do not begin early, though the
bishopric was founded A.D. mxcvn The Beana tuta! commenced about A.D. mcnxxv„
and continued till about A.D. unm—when ‘⁴ they all came into the bishop's hands?
according to the Historian of Norfolk; and ‘⁸ their jurisdiction into the archdeacon’s,''
·’ to whom they hadjbeen previously subject. Numerous notices of them occur in
Wilkins's Collection of the Coum—its, copied into our previous pag-es, (the earliest
there mentioned being in the Synodal Constitution of Bishop Walter de Suthfeld,
A.D. mcciv—CC. M. Β. etH. Vol. 1. p. 708): and distinct lists of the successive
benun of each beant& in the county of Norfolk are found in Mr. Bloomfield's History.
