chancellour of γ’ Mother Church¹ amg‘ us; as may verie reasonably be gathered
from the description made of his office in γ’ Decretals, L. 1. Tit. xx1v. cap. 1. 11. 111.
where amg‘ other things it is said, that it is· ye atthpttssbgttte dude—assidue in eecfid

(¹) By “y0 chancellour of γ· Mother Church amg‘ m,” Dr. Priaulx probably means in the
ehurch of Sar-unu but what peculiar functions thie chancellor perform, so as to approximate
more nearly than the imm to the type of the ancient attbptitfft of the city, the editor is at a
loss to discover. The tatbtlmtl 'finan ie, by common interpretation, the medem representative
Οἵ the &ttbfilmssbmtt urbanus or tihttatmziz, and no reason is known to the writer why the analogy
should not obtain in the church of Sarum, as well as elsewhere. ‘⁴ The chief over the comesam
or colleyn‘um presbyterorum, or the viee-prasos next to the bishop,” says Burnet, ‘⁸ was called
ertbipmbnttt or vetanus, idem quod decurio, qm* decem militibus praerat.” Observat. οπ tho
Second Δροσί. Canon, p. 58. Probably, Dr. Priaulx, in the course of transcribing copies of his
address, carelessly entered the chancellor instead of the Bran of the Mother Chureh.

mvorlon of Goar, p. 271, and again, p. 277, and note, p. 287. ’

(⁴) The «ἄξιε &ammae οἷς «3 ποιῆται ΠΡΩΤΟΠΡΕΣΒΠΕΡΟΝ, in the Greek Bitual referred to,
is too long for entire transcription; but as the learned editor of the Euoholoyy seems to think
that the ΠΡΩΊῸΠΑΠΑΣ was the then representative of the more ancient ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΣ, and
had authoritative superintendence over country presbyters ‘⁸ in vicis ,·’'—whereby he is rendered,
of course, a more interesting personage to a modern rutel Bran—(“proaeffmm huic, m09⁷²⁰ 8θᾶ

up by the εἰςχιιριιὶς at his ordination, will not, the writer. trusts, be deemed impertinent. The
volume whence it is extracted—from Dr. Parr's library at Hatton—is of some rarity, and not
likely to be found on the book-shelves of many of the rural clergy.

the ἅςχιιςρῦς, who places his hand upon his head, and thus prays :—
