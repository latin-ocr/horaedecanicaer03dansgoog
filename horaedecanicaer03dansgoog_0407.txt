wisunt, by Divine permission Bishop of chichester, To our well-beloved bnother,
————— ‚clerk,——·—-——-of———-—
within our diocese of chichester, greeting—

We being desirous to procure more frequent parochial visitations through the
archdeaconry of Chichester, within our diocese, than the archdeacon can himself
make, and confiding in your diligence and prudence, do, by these presents, constitute
and appoint you the said ————— to be tutal beau within the said
atchdeaconry; requiring your fidelity, care, and diligence, in observing, inquiring·
into, and, from time to time, making a report to us, or in our absence to the said
archdeacon, of all matters within the parishes mentioned in the schedule hereunder
written, and which are assigned to your care, or any of them, concerning which it
may be expedient that we should have information. And we particularly desire and
require you, at least once in every year, personally to visit and examine every church,
and chapel, and house of the minister, and the buildings and lands thereto belong·—
ing, within the same parishes. And we desire that, immediately after such examina-
tion, you make a special report to us in every case, where there shall be no house of
residence, or one wholly unfit, or where some addition may render it not unfit, sor
the residence of a clergyman3 but in all cases where repairs only are wanting for a
decent abode, that you deliver in writing under your hand to the minister or church-
wardens in each parish an order specifying the things which you shall judge neces-
sary to be repaired, amended, corrected, or done; and that you will, in such order,
require that the same order be, by such a limited time as you shall think proper,
returned to yon,with a certificate subjoined theret0, sig-ned by the minister or church-
wardens, specifying what has been done pursuant to such order. And we further
desire that the order and certificate, when returned to you, together with any obser-
vations you may think proper to make, may be forthwith transmitted to the said
archdeacon. By faithfully discharging the duties imposed on you by these presents,
yon, the said tuta! bran, will greatly assist us, your bishop, and also the said arch-
deacon. In witness whereof, we have caused our seal which we use in this behalf
to be affixed to these present, this day of in the
year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and , and in the

year of our consecration.
The Schedule of parishes above referred to.
