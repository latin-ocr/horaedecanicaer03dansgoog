THIS diocese consiste of the counties of Carlovv, Kilkenny, Queen's County, Wexford,
and part of the enunties of Wicklow and King's County. Ossory is divided‚ according
to Ware, into eight tuta! ῦεαιιῐίεβς viz. Siller, Claragh, Aghoure, Odoh, Kells, Obercon,
and Iverk. See Harris’s Ware's Worles‚ Vol. 1. p. 397. Ferus and Leighlin are also
so divided: pp. 553—583. But these divisions (Ι am informed by a kind corr&
spondent, Mr. Precentor Darby,) are now altered so as to give to the tuta! beans greater
facility of visiting, and more constant superintendenee of their districtS. There are at
present twelve ruta! beans in Ossory, nine in Ferns, and the same number in Leighlin.
Their names are recorded in Robertson’s Clerical Reyt‘sier, by King, for the
year uncccxmv.

The office of heau rutulis first brought under our notice in the see of Ossory by
Bishop Richard Ledred in his Synodal Constitutione, AD. mcccxx. See can. xxv. De
Sancta synoda, et lectura statutorum, and others. CC. Μ. Β. et H. Vol. 11. p. 504.

It appears, from an accurate search made by the Rev. C. Darby, Precentor of
Ossory‚ by desire of His Grace the Lord Primate, that there is no record in the
registry of any Commi-*sion issued to tuta! brana till the late Bishop Fowler's time,
who was consecrated in May nncccxm. The earliest ordinary Visitation-book, the
Precentor informs me, found in the registry, is for the year Moccxmv„ in which the
diocese was visited according to tuta! Uzentini, which are all stated, but the names of
tura! utam are not inserted. A similar method is observed in the visitation-books
for uncc1..—m1›cctv.—mncc1‚vn1.—»mccux.—unccxc11.-m›ccxcv.-Theintermediam
Visitation·books appear to have been lost or mislaid.

In the last-mentioned year, however, we have evidence of the restoration of the
office by Bishop O’Beirne3 which 1 extract from his Primam Charye: “1 take this
opportunity,’' says the bishop, ‘⁴ to return my warmest thanks to those gentlemen, my
most respectable brethren, who have so cheerfully and zealously undertaken the very
laborious task 1 have imposed on them in the restoration of the ancient office of tuta!
bean, and who are engaged in rendering me such essential services towards the
discharge of my duty. Their labours, 1 trust, will not be in vain. In the information
they have conveyed to me, 1 find much to rejoice at, much to lament: from hence-
forth, the object of my life, while God gives me health, shall be to endeavour to
strengthen and extend the one, and to remedy and correct the other.''¹

(¹) A subjoined foot—note by the bishop gives us the following additional information ε “ Rura!
Uenus vere of very ancient institution: their office was to inquire and search into the lives and
conversations, as well of the clergy as of the laity, who were within their Usamus, and to see
that the clergy duly served their cures and performed their duties according to the constitution
of the church; and if they found any of the clergy negligent of their duty, or any of the laity
blameworthy, they were, by their office, to rebuke and admonish them: and if admonition to the
clergy, and rebuke to the laity, would not make the one supply their cures and perform their
