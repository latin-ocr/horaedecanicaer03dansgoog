JOHN, by Divine permission Bishop of Lincoln, Το our well-beloved and
reverend brother AB. clerk, rector of C„ in the county and archdeaconry of D.

'rhat a ‘tumultus lacrymosus’ should ariae among the clergy, in the words of the annalis&
under such exactions as are above detailed, is not surprising; nor can we wonder that the
proctors of the archdeaconry of Lincoln were commissioned‚ in the name of the whole body of
beneficed clergy‚ to present a remonstrance ; of which one clause wiza, that Rostandus‚ the papal
official, ‘committit vices suas betunia ee aliis, eum adhue non constet de suci jurisdictione! (p. 356.)
