respondere tenentum proese-rlim cum ipsis [betunia nempe] referentibus, corrigere

This grant was, two years afterwards, confirmed by Archbishop Wethershed; but
with the addition of the clause, “proehabito consilio ποεῖν-σθ’ Both the instrumente
are printed at large by the industrIOus and judicious Mr. Somner.

The office of bean tutal, at and before this time, was to inspect the manners both
of clergy and laity within his district, but chiefly of the former; and if any of these
laboured under any evil fame, to call them before him; and to correct lesser
excesses as in oro poenitentiali for the most part, rather than judicially ,· the tuta!
beans being the consessores nati of the clergy under them, till the monks, about
King John's time, began to wrest the authority out of their hands.

His power over the clergy is by our Otho said to be “Jurisdictio coynilionalis,
quoad effectum corriqendi, licet non quoad effectum removendi tales a villicatione,
et suspendendo eos ab fficio? And in this Lyndwood agrees with him, allowing
that the beau tutal might inflict some of the lesser censures for slight offences: but
greater matters he was to refer to the superior ordinary, at the next synod, or con-
vention of the clergy; for which reason also he looks upon him to have been called
by the canonista testis synodalis.

From the cognizance of greater, and particularly of mirimonial causes, he was
entirely excluded by a constitution of Otho, both because he was not always sup·
posed duly qualified for a discussion of them, by his skill in canon law; and because
also, as 1 apprehend, his’office was often likely to determine ere such intricate causes,
where many witnesses were to be examined, could be ripened to a sentence. Nor
could he ever prescribe to a custom of hearing such causes3 because, as Lyndwood
well observes, by reason of a temporat-y office, no prescription lies· On this account,
as well as others, the office must needs afterwards have declined apace; because a
disuser would bar them of any branch of their authority, and no custom whatsoever
could either give them what they had not, or restore to them what they had lost.

It was likewise the bean tutal's business to instruct the younger clergy in the way
of administering and ordering sacraments and sacramentals, according to the canons
and customs of the church‚ to appoint preachers sor solemn occasions, to take care
of the sequestration of vacant livings, and to provide for the supplies of the cure.
He took order for, and certified the execution of, processes and decrees out of the
superior Court-Christian [and had perhaps on this account the title of betanus &chtis-
“unitatis bestowed on him}

Through his hands went the mandates for induction, and those for the choice of
convocation-clerks, which are still also transmitted by him. For this purpose he
had his apparitor-s, and other under-Officers, and an authentick seal, on which the
name of his office was engraved,1but not his own; that being allowed only to those
ecclesiasticae judyes who were perpetual; whereas the office of tuta! bean was tem-
por-ary, and of no longer continuance, even in Lyndwood’s time, than it is now.
