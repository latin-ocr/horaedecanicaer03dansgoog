throughout the diocese, and having the whole compass of it within the scope of their
observation and influence.

Such are the grounds on which you are now requested to revive your tuta! Φεραῖς,
and to call your brother clergy periodically around you: and when you read in your
commission that you are authorised and required to report all such matters to the
bishop as may be important ‘for him to know, and reflect further on the many growing
spiritual interests which come under this description, you oennot doubt either
roepecting the authority of your meetings, or the benefits which all parties may derive
from them.

To make this matter clearer, I shall offer a few remarks on the particular subjects
proposed for your consultation with the rutel chapter&

Among these, the diocesan association stands foremost, and well deserves the first
place in your deliberations; not only because it is expressly instituted for the
spiritual consolation and instruction of the household of faith around you—your own
people, your poorer neighbours and fellow—countrymen‚ in every stage and under
every circumstance of their Christian life3 but also because it comprises objects, every
one of which is peculiarly appropriate to your office as rural deans, and would
naturally have fallen under the review of the chapter& if they had continued to
exercise their functions. Church accommodation for the poor, and the due and
faithful administration of God’s ordinances and sacramenta for every rank, have been,
from time immemorial, subjects of bnaual inquiry and report, and continue to be
such even to the present day. The strong interest which has lately been excited in
their behalf in this county is only another reason for additional care and watch-
fulness on the part of those who are commissioned to superintend them. As to the
schools and schoolmasters which are now recommended to your charge, although in
ancient times they were not so distinctly committed to the tuta! Beana in England as
in other countries, yet from their first origin they have always been described as
subject to episcopal superintendence, and of late years, in several of our diocaees, have
been expressly included in the commissione issued by the bishops to the tuta! brana.
With the greatest fitness and propriety, therefore, our association, and its three great
objects, are now primarily confided to your councils3 and so important are they in
their bearing upon the general welfare, and so near and precious to every one of you
in their special interests and application, that, if they stood alone as matter of consul-
tation, they would be sufficient worthily to occupy the time, and to support the
character and spirit of your meetings. And in no hands could the association repose
the trust with so much cheerfulness and security. Hithert0, indeed, its course has
been prosperous and serene. Its funds, as well as its exertions, have gradually been
increasing; the zeal of its friends is unabated3 and the blessing of God has been
upon its labours. But it is in the nature of all voluntary societies gradually to fall
into decay, unless constant pains be taken to support them: and since it is obvious
from the constitution of our plan, that there is no security in future for its permanent
