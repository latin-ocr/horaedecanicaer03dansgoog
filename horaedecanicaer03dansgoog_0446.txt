THE diocese of Lincoln contains the enunties of Lincoln, Buckingham, Notting·
ham, and part of Hertfordshire. It is distributed into five archdeaconries: 1. Lincoln
—which is again divided into the mantin of Linoeln, Aswardburn cum Lafford‚
Aveland, Beltislaw, Bolingbroke, Candleshoe, Calcewaith, Gartree, Grantham‚
Graffoe, Grimsby‚ Hill, Horncastle, Holland, Longobovey, Loveden, Louthesk and
Ludburgh, Nesse, stamford, Walscrost, Wraghoe, and Yarburgh. 11. Stow—
divided into those of Aslacko, Coringham, Lawres‚ and Manlake. 111. Buckingham
—divided into those of Buckingham, Burnham‚ Mursley, Newport Pagnell, wad-
desden, wendover, and Wycombe ¹. 1v. Nottingham——divided into Bingham, Not-
tingham‚ Newark, Retford, and Southwell. v. Huntingdon (in part)-divided into
those of Baldock, Berkhamsteed, Hertford, and Hitchin, in the county of Herts ¹.

Within this extensive diocese there were, till lately, no ruta! Beuum but they are
now, I am happy to say, generally revived. The office, Bishop Kaye found, at the
period of his installatiom had long fallen into disuse, the only trace of it {hen
remaining being in the Mamm of Stamford²; where, the bishop says, it seems to
have been preserved eolely because the utun, in conjunction with the vicar of Au
Saims, Stamford, has the appointment of the wan-den, ᾃσ. of Brown’s Hospital in
that town.

Much, however, as the function had fallen into decay in modern days, it was of
early institution in this diocese. In the days of J effery, lay-bishop elect of Lincoln
(cir-citet· AD. Memfim), it certainly existed (Wharton’s Anylia Sacra, P. 11. p. 378);
and, at a later period, it flourished in au the vigour of its best days. During the
occupation of the see of Lincoln by Robert Grosthead, beans tuta! are again and
again mentioned in the epistolary correspondence of that eminent prelate with his
archdeacons and others, preserved by Mr. Brown in his valuable Fasciculus. See
Epp. 50. 84. 107. (Fasciculus Rerum, Tom. 11. pp. 340. 364. 382.) They are also
noticed in the “ Charta Lincoln. Ecclesia de consuetudinibus et libertatibus ejusdem
ecclesiae (AD. uccnx.),'' published by wilkins (CC. M. Β. et H. Vol. 1. p. 537. and
Reyistr. Moravieme, pp. 44, seqq.); wherein it is expressly stated that the churches of
the prebendaries and canons are to be exempt from ruti-bnans! jurisdiction: and
again in the Inquisitiom of A.D. mccxxx. p. 628. Nor are the traces of them few in the
