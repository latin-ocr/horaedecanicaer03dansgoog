with explanatione. When the temple is built, you are to make a list of all the
buildings belonging to the church, of the images, of the plate‚ of the vestments, of
the books, and of every thing required for the use of the church, as mentioned
above3 and to present it, at the same time as the petition from the parishioners for
permission to have their temple consecrated.

xv1. You are diligently to observe, that the priests, the deacons, and others
belonging to the church, but especially the prioetS, lead honest, steady‚ peaceable, and
conciliatory lives, becoming their stations; and that they be correct and orderly in
the performance of their duties: you are to take the greatest care that they be not in
the habit of intoxicating themselves, or of frequenting public-houses; but that they
conduct themselves soberly, and in a manner becoming servants of the altar and
Christian pastors. But if you remark any one osten intoxicated, disgracing himself
by drunkenness‚ or performing his sacred duties when not in a sober state, you are
to present such a one, without any concealment.

xvn. To take care that the priests perform the Liturgy or Communion Service
without fail, at least on Sundays, and on other holy and solemn days; and that, on
other days, they chaunt the Chassv, perform the Vespers and Matius, and do not
neglect the Liturgy of the proeauctified appointed for the forty days (between the
Resurrection and Ascension).

xvm. That no service be performed by those who are at enmity until they be
reconciled.

x1x. You are to insist strongly, O Ξῦῑαᾳοεῇειιηοί, that your priests keep the holy gists
(for the use of the church) in the churches, at the altar, in silver-boxes3 or, in case of
need, in pewter; and that they frequently inspect them, that they receive no injury;
and from henceforth not to allow the priests to keep these holy gists in their homes,
under a heavy penalty ; and when there is a necessity of taking them into the housoe
of the parishioners, for the sake of administering the Sacrament to the sick, that the
priests walk with a decorum suitable to such a mystery‚ and carry them on their
breasts, either in boxes made of superior materials on purpose for them, or in cloth bags.

xx. Holy Baptism is to be performed in the church‚ in the presence of the deacons
and other church·servants; unless some very important cause should require the
child to be baptized in the house. The child is not to be baptized (immersed) in
water which is too cold, or mixed with ice, especially during the winter, lest it should
injure the health of the child.

xxi. The priests are not to allow dead bodies to remain longer than twenty-four
hours in the church; and not to allow them to remain at all there, except in casoe of
absolute necessity; but as soon as they are brought, to read the funeral service over
them, and bury them where it is prescribed.

(¹) Chassi—literally, Hours. Corresponding to the Hora of the R. C. Church-prayers with-
out the Liturgy, whenever they may be read.
