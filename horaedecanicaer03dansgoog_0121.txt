811. C. XL] &ustum of Rutal &baptttffi—Examtnatlon of §tholam

The litans tutal of the province of Rouen, in general,
had much to do with parochial education. They were
ordered to watch over, inspect, and examine, by persona!
nfitation, all the fithools andseminaries of their litantia—
as we have noticed, in earlier pages, under the head of
vg‘fitatiomzl sanction-5. In the diocese of Bois-le-duc, it ‚geatfflnodi
devolved on the attbptitsts of the tomum, with their Ίῖἷηξῖψιῗί
affembled thaptttz, to select competent instructors for 330021‘142 ’
the initiation of novices in the rites and ceremonies of lssfffiffffflff'
the Romish church3 and in that os Cologne‚ it behoved ffi‘fffufflffffl
the same {nuttiunatftss to point out befitting persons to ἶ
the bishop, or his vicar-general, for approval and appoint- ι
ment to the same trust. Indeed the notices are frequent
in the Concilia Germanice, of Beana tutal having to do
with parochial education—in the examination, registra-
tion, and licensmg of masters, as well as the inspection
and regulation of the schools themselves, and their
inmateS. Nor are the modern forms of nnana! com-
miffion in England and Ireland unobservant os the duties
of our episcopal &putica in connexion with parochia]
education3 though such duties are generally, it must be .
confefl'ed, of a personal nature, and not intended to be
exercised by the capitular huby collectively. Indeed no
recent formula of appointment, I am sorry to say, recog-
nizes the existence of the tuta! chapter sor this or any

other purpose of ecclefiastical administration. Bishop aaa Vol.11.

Chiclaefler alone enters upon the subject of diocesan

education as at all falling within the province of capitular i
deliberation. .
