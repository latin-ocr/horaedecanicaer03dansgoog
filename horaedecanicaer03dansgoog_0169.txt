There exists, then, 1n the Greek church of Ruffia, as Ex 319111.

I am informed‚ an office not unlike that of the heau tutal 1¹3? re εαξιῗῖῗύι

in our own. The duties are nearly the same. The *affc‘mn ’⁸15⁶th

Ruffian functionary has the inspection of the morals of
the clergy, the manner in which they perform their*
ministerial dutieS‚ and the state of the rural churches
(but not of the glebe-manses ¹), within a certain ὤίὶῑίοῐ,ἐ
usually comprehending eight or ten pariihes. Of thesel

(¹) The duty of rutal beans, or blagotbaenniae, does not extend to the
inspection os personage-house& and the reason is this :—

In the villages, the parsonage-houses are the private property, with
certain limitatione, of the respective incumbents. Each pariih has a
certain portion ofland appropriated to the church 3 of which the minister ·
has a share, and which, with the surplice seen, constitutes his entire ’
income. The personage is built on the glebe; but on the demise of
one incumbent, and the succeffion of another (appointed by the synod, on
the recommendation of the bishop, who is osten influenced' m his choice ⁴
by the chief lauded proprietor and sarmers of the parish), the parsonage
remains the property of the family of the late incumbent. ι

parsonage as a matter of course. But, in the event of there being no
souin orders, or none eligible, the husband os the eldest daughter,
being a clergyman, is capacitated to take pofl'effion of the manse 3—
which arrangement is osten the means of getting the eldest daughter a

husband, however aged she may be, or destitute of personal charms ³⁸.

An old priest lately died, leaving two daughters, neither very fair nor very young.
ln the course of a mouth, his place was filled; and one of the weeping orphans
duly installed in her mother’s place (pastor's wife), a smiling bride.
