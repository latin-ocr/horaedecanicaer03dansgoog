necessities of the saints; and which annex the highest and most enduring rewards to
those who turn many to righteousnesS. On the other hand, it is subversive of all
social happiness and peace. The nearer we are drawn by the conditione and rela-
tions of life to those who stand in need of our assistance, the oftener we come
personally in contact with them, the more graceful‚ healing, and acceptable does our
sympathy become3 and on the contrary, the more offensive and unnatural our
neglect. Indeed‚ this is only one symptom among many of that moral disorder which
prevails through a large portion of our social system, and is pregnant with so much
alarm3 separating, by a broad and dark line, those who labour with their hands
from their employers, producing selfishness on one side, sullenness and discontent on
the other; and, what is worse, intercepting the course of every im11rovement in
morals and religion, which otherwise would naturally flow down from the more
instructed orders to their poorer brethren. With every allowance for the different
forms and modifications of civil life, it is impossible to deny that this our state is an
entire departure, in principle as well as practice, from that primitive Christianity
wherein all its members were of one heart and one mind. Nor can any hope be
entertained of arresting the progress of this disorder, and of soothing the distempered
feeling which is the consequence, unless by retracing our steps, and by restoring to
our society the spirit of that Christian charity‚ which so sweetly temper-ed theim—-
unless the sympathies and feelings of Christian brotherhood are acknowledged and
established amongst us in all their strength—unless every rank and order shall be
made to feel for every other as for itself, and all be knit together by the ties of mutual
respect, as well as of kindness and affection. Other measures may indeed be useful,
and concur to the same end 3 but this is the one thing needful, without which every
other will be in vain. For we may be assured, that no device can be imagined so
calculated to win the hearts of the lower orders to the love of Christ and of the
Gospel, as to let them witness the force of it in those above them, prompting every
one, and warning every one, to seek, not their own things, but the things of others
and of Christ, and to be constantly intent upon improving the condition and raising
the spiritual character of their poorer brethren. Here, then, is another topic highly
worthy of your couneus, and fit for minds of piety and intelligence engaged in the
sacred functions of the ministry. The error, however, is one which should be
touched tenderly and kindly, as a failing of weaker brethren, to which minds of
greater intelligence have only just been awakened3 but firmly and searchingly as
an evil of great magnitude, already deeply rooted in our system, which, if suffered to
increase, is calculated to deform the beauty and to disturb the fair proportions of our
Church, to arx-est the progress of the Christian scheme, and finally to subvert the
whole fabric of society.

I trust, my reverend brethren, that you will bear with me a moment longer upon
this point, which I deem to be of great importance. It may be true, that the defect
of which I am speaking ought in this case to be imputed mainly to want of know·
