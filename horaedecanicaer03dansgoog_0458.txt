Charye, uncccxx1„ ‘⁴ Ι feel particularly indebted to that valuable body of clergy, the
tuta! braum by whose circumstantial inquiries into the state of the parishes placed
under their respective superintendence such full and (Ι doubt not) faithful repre-
sentations have been made to me of almost every town, village, and hamlet, as
⁸ enables me, with comparative ease, to judge what improvements have been already
made, or may hereafter be practicable, in points of real importance. Great, too, is
the advantage Ι have derived from their personal and local knowledge, in contending
with difficulties which Ι might otherwise have found insuperable. For the cheersul

' alacrity, and, in some instances. laborious exertion‚ with which this assistance has

been rendered, Ι am happy thus publicly to express my grateful acknowledgments.
Upon a compar-ison of the returns made by the tuta! beans to my predecessor in the
year 1817, with those made in the years 1819 and 1820, Ι observe, with pleasure, a
manifest and still progressive improvement in several matters of general interest.'’

During the short period that Bishop Sumner occupied the see of Llandaff, tutal
btanss appear to have been in the full exercise of their useful functions. They are
addressed by his lordship, in his Primary Charge in uncccxxvn„ in the following
words :—“ The appointment of tuta! beans has been attended‚ in its degree, with
similar good effects ;'’ (his lordship had been speaking of the improved condition of
ecclesiastical buildings, owing to the ability and zeal of the chancellor) ‘⁸ and Ι take
this opportunity of stating, that those individuals who have kindly consented to sacri·
fice a portion of their time in this service, will render me essential assistance, by
transmitting, on or before the first of January in every year, a detailed report of the
state of the churches, glebe-houses, and glebe—lands under their superintendence.
I hope I am not expecting too much in requiring this annual survey from them,
considering the value *of the information Ι shall thus obtain, and the expence which
may be saved eventually to the parishes and to incumbents by a little timely and
judicious repair. ¹Let me also call their attention to the necessity of restraining
churchwardens, or others, from making alterations without the sanction of the or-
dinary. In all cases, except those of mere repair and restoration, the plan of any
proposed change, interior or exterior, should be submitted to him, and receive his
approval, before it is carried into execution. Had due attention been paid to this
rule, some os those deformities would never have been permitted to exist, which now
disfigure the regularity or obstruet the convenience of too many of our churches
throughout the country. If, through inadvertence, the parishes most contiguous to
the residence of the tuta! Deam& have, in some instanceS, not been assigned to them,
I shall be ready to consult their wishes, by making any change which circumstances
appear to render desirable.”

Bishop Copleston informs me that he ‘⁴ has always been in the habit of requesting

of Bishop Sumner’s, as worthy of all commendation.
