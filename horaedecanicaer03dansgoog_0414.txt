powerful means and instrumenta for propagating the Gospel‚ so seasonably collected
and brought to perfection at home-the many faithful hearts and learned tongues which
are enlisted in its service—and the providential care in which the way has been pre-
pared for the reception of the truth by the breaking down of the strong-holds of
idolatry in the east—constitute such an overwhelming evidence of a divine power
going along with their efforts. that it is difficult to conceive any mind so dull as not
to be stirred with admiration for the work, or so sordid as to refrain from contributing
to its support. With such arguments you can scarcely plead in vain= and if ever
the chilling question should come across the mind of any one whom you address,
‘⁶ of what avail can be the best-directed efforts of one or two societies volunteering
their services in so vast a field ?’' then let him be reminded‚ that it was by a small
but seasonable aid from the Society for Propagating the Gospel that the expiring
embers of the episeopal church in Ameriea were, with the blessing of Almighty God,
kept alive, when abandoned by the authorities at home, and depressed and trampled
upon by the adverse sects which vindictively surrounded it; and that this very
church‚ then like “ the Syrian ready to perish‚'' thus timely rescued from destruction,
is now so prosperous and flourishing, though dependent only upon its own apostolic
character, and the affection and zeal of its members, that it numbers more than twenty
bishops‚ 1000 clergy, and 800,000 members within its pale, having quadrupled its
numbers during the same period that the general population has required for
doubling¹; and, what is more directly to our present purpose, that it is now, by
means of its own resources, propagating throughout the world that form of Christi-
anity which was then, under God, preserved to it by our well-timed aid. Surely no
one can listen to these extraordinary resultat, and be afraid to have his lot with these
societies‚ which, through saith in the Saviour’s promise, and in obedienee to his last
command, are now casting their bread in every direction upon the waters, assured of
finding it after many days.

Other advantages there are, likely, indeed almost certain, to grow out of these
re-unions, on which Ι need only glance; namely‚ the promotion of social intercourse
and comfort among persons engaged in the same high calling, aiming at the same
ends, and encompassed with the same dangers and temptations; the communication
and diffusion of tried improvements in the pastoral and ministerial eare; mutual
assistance and encouragements in congenial studies3 the wider exertions and influenee
of superior minds in the prosecution of what is good3 and more than all, perhaps,
a clearer insight into the moral state and condition of the people in every district, and
a more uniform and systematic application of the means calculated to improve them.

(¹) It appears from Mr. Caswall's work on the American Episcopal Church, that the revenues
applicable to Missionary purposes were doubled (from 60001. to 12,0001.) in a single year, by substi-
tuting‚ for the former system of Missionary Associations, a weekly oblation at the time of the

Holy Communion in every parish throughout the church.
