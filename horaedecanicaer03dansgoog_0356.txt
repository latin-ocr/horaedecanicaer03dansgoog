in gowns and boots; and those attached to the church, in long suitable garments,
and boots; especially in the church, or when they are going anywhere for the per·
formance of their duties.

xuv. If orders are given you, either from the archbishop‚ or from the consistory,
or from the spiritual authorities, to make investigations concerning any one, you are
to make them according to the orders given, with strict justice3 neither favouring
your friend, nor revenging yourself on your enemy; and without loss of time to make
your report, where it is required-

κω. The blagotbmnot is to see that the priests have their lists of penitents (who
confess themselves), and the church-register, ready to be delivered; and for this
purpose, they are to have their copy-books prepared from the very beginning of the
year.

var. To watch over the churchwardens, that they set down all their collections

the law, it is your duty, both in private and in the church, to convince, exhort, and
correct (those who are guilty of such offences); threatening them with the judgment
