Be pleas'd therefore to know, that γ’ office of a bishop being not onlie tbe most
eminent for honour, but the greatest for burden in the church of Christ (of weh the
manie passages of Scripture that concern that function, as well as the canons of
antient councills, and y‘ sayings and exemples of y‘ fathers doe informe us¹) it was
thought fullie necessarie, that some part of the burden should be taken off from the
bishops, and plac't in the care and managerie of such, whom the church thought
fittest to be intrusted therewffi. Which practise, both for y‘ necessitie, reasonablenes

and lawfullnes thereos, is grounded upon severall precedents in the word of God :—

as appeares by w‘ Moses did in conferring part of y‘ burden of civill governm‘ on
70 of the elders of Israel², Numb. xi.—-by w‘ o'. Saviour himself did, in adding
γ’ like number of disciples to his Holie Apostles, allreadie in commission for
preaching³, Luke x.-—and also by w‘ was done by the Apostles of o'. Lord, in
transferring γ’ office of ministring the πτωχικὰ ⁴, γ’ goods of γ’ poore, upon an order

ixlilstitut⁵ed for thpt purpose, whom they therefore call'd deaconS, or ministers of the
c urch , Acts v1.
