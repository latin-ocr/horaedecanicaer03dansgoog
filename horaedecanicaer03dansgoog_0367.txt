Upon this “ appointment of rural deans‚” archdeacon Wilberforce remarks, in
his Char-qe »meconium—‘⁶ Ι look at this not only as lightening my own labourS, ιο
which it will greatly contribute, and for which Ι sincerely thank those who have
given me their assistance, but still more as completing the organization of the
clergy, as facilitating their communicatiom as combining and concentrating their
powers- In this view, my reverend brethren‚” says he, addressing the clergy,
‘⁴1 look upon this accession to our discipline as signally important. If you will
give thoee functionaries your full confidence, will regard them as the natural means
of confederation and concord, we shall grow in unity, and, 1 need not add, in strength.

May God's blessing then, without which there can be neither strength nor concord,
be given to this revival of an ancient institution, and may He vouchsafe to increase
our energy, our wisdom, and our love !’'
