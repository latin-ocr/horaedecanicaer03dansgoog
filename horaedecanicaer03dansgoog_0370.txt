office of some considerable trouble, and no emolument; and for the effective and
judicious manner in which they have performed its dutioe. They will laern with
satisfaction, what each of them knows in his own particular case, that the experi-
ment, as far as it can be judged of from one year's trial, has been eminently
successful. A machinery has been formed which enables me, through the medium
of the archdeacons, to communicate with all the clergy os the diocese 111 the speediest
and most confidential manner3 while, on the other hand, I shall from year to year
be made intimately acquainted with the real state of their parishes, in respect to all
material points of ecclesiastical interest. I should not do justice to my own feelings,
were 1 not to offer my hearty thanks to the clergy in general, throughout the diocese,
for their prompt and cheerful acquiescence in this arrangement. With scarcely more
than one exception, they have afforded every sacility to the tuta! beans, in the
execution of their office: and, 1 am bound to add, that an equal degree of readiness
has been manifested by the churchwardens, to frame their presentments with due
consideration and care, and to fumish the rutel beans with the means of verifying
their statements.''—Charye delivered to tlte Cleryy of tlte Diocese qs London at tlte
Visitation in July uncocxxxw. pp. 31, 32, 333 and Appendioe (111), p. 64.

The Bishop very kindly informs me (Sept. 1843) that he has found the assistance
of his rutel beans very valuable in communicating with the parochial clergy of his
diocese, and in their superintendence of the ecclesiastical buildings within their
respective beantloesst and further, that he is considering how far it may be advisable
to recommend to them the adoption of a plan which has been acted upon with grfflt
advantage in the diocese of chichester, that of holding periodical matinga of th'e
clergy within their mantica, for the purpose of discussing matters of ecclesiastica]
interest.
