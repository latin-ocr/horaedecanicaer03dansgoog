the bishop, should take certain oaths, and make certain declarations and subscrip-

A. Β., ιο be our romatinum, for the purpose of administering to all stipendiary
curates, whom we may intend to license within the beant& of D„ the oaths of alle-
giance, supremacy, and canonical obedience, and for seeing them make such decla-
rations and subscriptions as are by law required ς that, before we sign the licence of
every such stipendiary curate, we may be certified that all things have been done in
due order. And we also hereby constitute you our commissary within the said henum,
sor reporting to us in the manner of such commissions as we may see fit to issue for
the exchange of glebe-lands, or the building, rebuilding, improving, or repairing
glebehouses, or for the laying out of money appropriated to a benefice by the
Governors of Queen Anne’s Bounty.
