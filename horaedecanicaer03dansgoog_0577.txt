Secia VI.] murm of the isles. 561

SECT. VL—Biotese of the lisles.

“THIS diocese contained formerly, not only the AEbudae or Western Isles, but also
the Isle of Man, which, for 500 years last past, has been a separate bishopric.” The
prelates of this diocese had heretofore three places of residence3 viz. the Isles of
Icolmkill, Man, and Bute3 and they were promiscuously called ‘⁴ Episcopi Manniae
et Insularum,'’ “Episcopi AEbudarum,’' and “ Episcopi Sodorenses”; “ which last
title,'' Bishop Keith tells us, ‘⁴ is still retained, both by the bishops of the Isles and of
Man3 since this see was divided into these two dioceses in King David the Second’s
reign, and seems to have been given them’srom a church, the cathedr-al in Icolmkill,
dedicated to our Saviour, for whom the Greek name is Soter, hence sotorensis and
Sodorensis.” (Hist. Catal. of S. Β. by Russell, p. 293.)

Deam} tuta! appear to have administered this diocese, or at least the English part
of it, under the bishop, in the middle of the fourteenth century. Whether Bishop
Russell presided over the divided sees at first is not quite clear. The Synodal Con-
stitui-lons of Sodor issued by him (ΑΒ. mocon), wherein tuta! beans are mentioned,
have been referred to under the English Documents relating to that see. (CC. M. B.
et H. Vol. 111. p. 10.)

THE diocese of Barbados consists of the islands of Barbadoe, Trinidad, Grenada,
St. Vincent, TobagO, and St. Lucia. It is divided into two archdeaconries3 viz.
1. Barbados-—containing the tuta! nunties of Barbados and St. Vincent, including
St. Lucia. 11. Trinidad-—containing the tura! hauries of Trinidad with Tobago¹,
and Grenada. '

At the conclusion of Part vr. Sect. 111. Ι have noticed, with much satisfaction, the
institution of beans tura! in this diocese by Bishop Coleridge; and Ι sincerely hope
that the example of so wise and efficient a ruler will not be lost upon our other
colonial prelates‚ as soon as their respective dioceses will admit of a perfect ecclesias-
tical organization. To Bishop Coleridge Ι am indebted for the following commission
issued to the ruta! beans of his diocese on their first appointment, and likewise for
the particulars of the changes wrought in the old diocese of Barbados and the
Leeward islands by the erection of the independent sees of Antigua and Guiana.

(¹) It is probable, Bishop Parry thinks, that the island of.Tobago may be hereafter consti-

tuted a distinct Beuum.
