Atterburs’s Ι “ In matters of public government ” (I agree with the
ommisti- archdeacon of TotnesS‚ and would that in after-life he

had practised what he taught Ξ) “it is the business of
private persons to make the best use they can os the
present state of things, without endeavouring to disturb
‚3 it by new models and schemeS‚ which they think may
L be of more service ¹. But when a main branch of our
’ξ ancient ecclefiastical constitution hath been dropped by
a gradual disuse‚ no man’s modesty needs restrain him
„ from interposmg, towards a revival of it. And that is
the case of tuta! munz and thapt2t53 which is no new-
fangled device, but an institution of venerable age, by
long experience approved, and practised with greater
influence and success in this than in any other part of
Christendom. We are sure, therefore, that² it is well

1 adapted to our constitution, and would be so far from
ἰ interfering‚ that it would fall-in with the other parts of
it, and even contribute to support and strengthen them;

(¹) ‘⁴ There is no surer way to reform wisely,’' says Biflnop Gibson in

Ι the Preface to his Codex I. E. A. p. xv.. ‘⁶ and to render reformatione of

all kinds unexceptionable and inoffenfive, than the restoring of ancient

discipline (which has been lost by disuse) where it appears to be for the

benefit of the church.’' (Eun-on.) ff

A Humble pm„ (²) We need not sear, in the words of an anonymous Lincolnshire
{ifffit'e'soff‘r'n'ffi presbyter, ‘⁶ that such nuans and chaptm wiu be found contrariam ιο
tion, ειο. p. 42. ζ the law, or repugnant to royal authority-3 seeing that very certificate of
j all the judges os England‚ made in answer to the question of the Lords
, of the Star-Chamber‚ about the lawfulness of church proceedings and
³. visitatione, resolves, ⁴ that bishops, archdeacons, and other ecclesiastic-al
ι persons, may keep their visitatione as usually they have done, without
P commission under the great seal so ιο do!' Nor ought they ιο do any
thing but what the diocesan himself may do; sor they act by his power,

ι and in his stead. So that if their meeting be unlawfu1‚ acting regularly

· ξ under him, his power would be also unlawful.”
