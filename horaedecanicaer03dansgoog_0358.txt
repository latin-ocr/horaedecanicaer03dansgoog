church, who have conducted themselves with propriety. He is to make notes in the
copy-book of these fines, and to keep them for referenoe3 and to send them, every
year, to the diocesan: but if the person be not reformed by all these modes of correc-
tion, he is to present him. Also immediately to report, for the information of the
bishop, if he has suspended any one from performing his sacred duties.

1.v111. The Blagotbtnnoi has a seat, not only in the meeting of the spiritual
authorities, but also in the consistory, whenever he has any presentments to them,
in the course of his duty.

mx. The Blagotbtmtoi has precedence of all other priests who do not fill the same
office.

Lx. The Blagotbrnnoi has the power, during his absence on duty, to entrust the
performance of service in the church, and elsewhere, to any one of his subordinate
priests, whom he may appoint, without making him any pecuniary payment:
because he does not absent himself on his own affairs, but for the common benefit
of the church.

Lxx. The priests and deaeons are to shew all respect and obedience to the mago-
cbtnnot. On his arrival, to meet him at the church: and not to sit in his presence,
or cover their heads without his permission; and to shew him all manner of polite-
nesS, in their reception of him at their houses. ¹

an. And as the Blagotbtnnoi deserves a particular reward for his labours, he is
committed to the good providence of God, who will reward all those who keep a
virtuous course in this way of life. He is assured of the particular regard of his
diocesan3 who, esteeming his zeal, his cares, and labours, will not neglect him3 but
will reward him, either with a better living, with the permission to officiate in a
Nabedrennilc ¹, and with the rank of wrote-prabum.

mun. And since, by these rules, a particular confidence is placed in the ”lago-
tbtnnoi, it is to be hoped that he will perform the trust committed to him, with a
clear conscience, in the fear of God; neither oppressing nor entangling any one by
injustice or injury3 for in such an event, which God forbid! he will have a heavy
responsibility, and be subject to heavier punishments than a common priest for the
same fault.

Lxxv. For sending messages and parcels, the ”Iagotbtmtoi should constantly have
by him one of the acting church-servants, or one not yet placed, according to the
selection of the priests and those attached ιο the church, half-yearly or yearly, as they
may decide in common. And for a time, if there occur much business and mes-
sages, he may take another of the church-servants3 and has a right to make use of
