‘⁸ Bishop Douglas, aster having presided over the diocese many years, finding
numerous complaints of dilapidations of churches and glebe-bouses, and recollecting
what had taken place in his former diocese of Carlisle ¹, resolved to appoint tnta! beans
in that of Sarum. But, after several consultations on the subject, his lordship gave
up his intention, being of opinion that it exceeded his authority. He also, like Bishop
Barrington, gave particular imeruceiom to his archdeacons to investigate the com·
plaints which had been made3 an'd a satisfactory report was afterwards rendered to
the bishop on the subject of them.'' See my remarks on Mr. Boucher's Letter, a few
pages back.

Since the second revival of the office by Bishop Fisher (AD. uncccv11.—Mncccxxv.)
—for I give Bishop Ward the merit of the first—(and both prelates were probably
induced to restore it from having seen its utility in the diocaee of Exeter, whence
they were respectively translated to Sarum)—the diocesan alone has appointed to it;
—the archdeacons, and sometimes the clergy mentioning to the bishop the names of
individuals qualifled for the office3 not, however, as exercising any right of co-elec-
tion—for the office is considered as being vested in the bishop’s personal jurisdiction
—but as willing helpmates in'support of church-discipline, and, generally speaking,
most capable from their local knowledge of the different nunties, and their personal
knowledge of the resident clergy, to point out to the diocesan the fittest persons to
fulfil the charge; which is held for such a term as the bishop may think expedient—
i.e. durante epi-scopi beneplacito,

Such was the constitution of the office under the late venei-able Bishop Burgess:
who rendered it much more effective² during· his occupation of the see of Sarum,
by enjoining· on his beans tuta! annual or more frequent inspection of churches and
chapels, with their ornaments and furniture, churchyards, manses, &a t—by circulating
periodically Visimtion-Artzcles of Inqm‘ry, to be formally filled up by them, and
deposited in the archives of the see ;—by 'distributing mandates, and prosecuting·
inquisitione, where necessary, by the instrumentality of beans tuta! ;—and lastly‚ by
holding a yearly conference of all the beans of the three archdeaconries of the diocese,

(¹) There is no vestige of the office having ever existed in the diocese of Carlisle.

(²) The effective condition of the office of beau rutal in the archdeaconry of Sarum is thus
vouched for by the venerable Liscombe Clarke, in his Char-90 delivered to the cleo-99. AD.
uncccxx'x. “With regard to other important archidiaconal duties, viz. the visiting the several
churches within the archdeaconry, and ascertaining, for the information of the bishop, by
personal inspection, the state of these sacred buildings, together with that of the glebe-houses
and glebe·lands, much is done, and done efficiently, in this diocese by the παπαῖ beans» whose
exertions have been intended, in many instances, with the best effects. They are therefore

ῗὲἶίἑὶοᾱ ιο 1171uch praise for so kindly consenting to devote a portion of their time to this service.''
