qurefentatiom and by the verdict of such inquest could
prejudge the present incumbent, and give poffeffion to
a new clerk3 till the abuse of this power occasioned a re-
gulation of it in the council at Lambeth (A. D. MCCLXXXI). cc. ΜΒ. ειη.
Such is the summary statement of Biihop Kennett3 and v⁰¹ ¹¹ ¹² 00
Ι believe it to be correct.
The whole process of the ancient1 inqug'fitio (of which
the modern jus patronam formed a part) “ per quam {25¹³ d'ssff’i'. m.

(¹ ) It was the practice of the thirteenth century, upon the death of an John son ’020-
incumbent, ιο have a jury consisting· half of the clei-gy, half of the laity, ᾕεῇῗέἓῃι
and the bissmp, or his representative, pressding· as judge, · in which the
right of pati-onage, and the qualifications of the clerks presented, were
determined. Against the abuse of these ordinary inquests, as too often l
perverted under the prefidency of Beana tuta! to the violation of benefices
actually full, the Lambeth Constitutions provide. To oppose such an
official‘ ‘inqufitio dejure patronam-⁹? upon a church becoming vacant,

was an excommunicable offence.
