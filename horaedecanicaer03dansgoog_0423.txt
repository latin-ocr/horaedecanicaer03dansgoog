In our earlier pag-es, many items of tuti-Bttanal service have been adduced from the
councils of this see. Beana rutel appear therein‚ for the first time, during the
episcopati! Of Peter Quivil (A.D. uccmxxvnQ, under the title of lotorum οτῡίιιετίί-
(CC. M. B. et H. Vol. 11. p. 158.) They are ⁴not mentioned in either of the Eccle-
siastical V alors.

The office is said to have been kept up in the diocese ab αηίίᾳιιος but 1 have no
direct evidence to adduce of its existence, from the date above alluded to (unless the
notice bestowed on the office by Bishop Ha11‚in his Modest Offir, may be appropriated
to this diocese, of which he was bishop) till the reign os Queen Anne: when it seems
to have been in a flourishing condition, under the auspices of Bishop Trelawney.
'Hie usages¹ of that period (scarce differing, in any essentia] point, from those of
modern days) are supplied by Dr. Atterbury, in his annexed Λᾶόν-833 to me Cleryy qf
tloe Archdeaconry of Totness (A.D. unccvm.)
