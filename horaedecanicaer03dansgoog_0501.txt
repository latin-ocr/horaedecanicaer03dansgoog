The thottpiztopal duty referred to by Dr. Priaulx, on the authority os Basil (Epist. ctxxn.
p. 193), has been, at different times, fulfilled by archdeacons and total mann and so also that,

Still it may be inserted, from the subscriptions of chorepiscopi to councils in this and the next
century, that they remained frequent in the East. At the council of Nice, two thottpistopi
