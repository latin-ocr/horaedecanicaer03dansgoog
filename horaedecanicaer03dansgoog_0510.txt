From the year mncnxxxvm„ when Bishop Burnet succeeded Bishop Ward, the
office of heau tuta! seems to bave become extinct in the diocese of Sarum, till it was
revived in the episcopate of Bishop Fisher¹. There are no traces of its existence
during the incumbencies of Bishops Burnet, Talbot, Willis, Hoadly, Sherlock, Gilbert,
Thomas, Drummond, Thomas, Hume, Barrington, and Douglas. That Bishop
Burnet should have allowed the tuti-Beuum! administration, which his predecessor
had turned to such good account, to be entirely broken up, is most strange and unin-

telligible. He seems to have regretted that the office had no means of remuneration

(Hinc. oflzis own Ta‘mes, Vol. w. p. 186. oxf. Edit), and suggests that 201, or 301. should
be given to each tuta! Bran, if possible, out of mefirstfruits and (eutha. But if the
office worked well without pay in Ward’s days, why should it have been discontinued‚
on the plea of no salary, by his successor?

Respecting the intentions of Bishops Barrington and Douglas, in reference to the
office, Mr. Boucher supplies the following information. ‘⁶ Bishop Barrington once
proposed to appoint tuta! Draus for the purpose of prosecuting a parochial visitation
of the diocese3 and, with that view, drew up and printed Articles <ff Inquit-y for each
parish and chapelry within the countiae of Wilts and Berks, to be filled up by the
tuta! beans, and returned to him at a given time. But finding, subsequently, that he
was not author-ised by custom to take any such steps (no evidence of such an appoint-
ment appearing in the registry of episcopal acts) he laid it aside; and instead thereof,
adopted the plan of giving a special commis-sion to the archdeacons of the diocese,
authorising and enjoining them to make a parochia] visitation of their several archdea·
conries. And, for that purpose, he supplied them with duplicate copies of Articles of
Inquit-y, in sufficient number to allow ofone for each parish and chapelry, to be filled
up and lest at the place, and another to be returned to the bishop. Such returns
were made, and afterwards bound together, and deposited in the bishop's private

(¹) The formula of appointment employed by Bishop Fisher on the occasion of his reviving
the office in the diocese os Sarum, was exactly the same as that previously in use in the dioceses
of Bristol and Bath and wells—mutatis mutandis. It is not necessary, therefore, to repr-int
it here.
