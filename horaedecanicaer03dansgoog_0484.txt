There is no notice of Beana tuta! in this diocese, either in Wilkins’s Cone-ilia or
in the Ecclesiastical V alors of the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries· Nor have 1 any
ancient authorities to adduce in illustration of their history in this part of the
Principality.

They appear to have been established, however, in the episcopate of Bishop Horsley;
and certainly, during the many years that Bishop Burgess² occupied the see of Saint
David’s, they were efficiently ministerial to his lordship as parochial visitors3 in
which capacity they were furnished with a Commission and Articles of Inquiry to
the fullest extent. And if any particular notice or inquisition⁸ was, at any time,
required to be set on foot in the rural districte, previous to visitation or confirmation,
or at other times, the Beana alone were employed upon it 3—the archdeacons being
mere dig-nitaries, exereising no jurisdiction, holding no visitations, and possessing no
privileges», beyond the titles of their respective offices, and the estates annexed to theru:¹

(³) We are told by Mr. Marriott, that it was the eustom of Bishops Burgess and Jenkinson, in
case of receiving any information against clergymen, first to employ the ntra! litans to inquire
and repert whether they thought there was sufficient cause for a Commissiom and isso, to
appoint one. See Ecclesiastical Coures' Rapere, uncccxxxn. Mr. Marriott’s Evidmoe, p. 251.

(⁴) The libraries established for the use of the parochial clergy, in each 112an of the diocese,
by the Religious and Πίσωνι] Αεεοοίαιίοη sor the Promoeion os Christian Knowledye and Chardi
Union, were subject to the direction of the tutal 'man during Bishop Burgess’s episcopate. See
Traces on the Oriyin and Independence os the Brieish Churola, p. 150.

(ὅ) “ One of the objecta which it (the appointment of tuta! orans) answers, is, to convey infor·
mation to the bishop. Even this will be more fully accomplished when the visitatione of the
tnta! litans shall be performed more regularly, and a report of every thing worthy of remark be
periodically transmitted to the bishop. But another important braneh of their office is, to serve
as centres of unity for the cler-gy of the *orantia ; and this has either never been attempted, or
has generally failed. 1 am convinced that great benefit would be likely to arise from meetings
of the clergy, held periodically in each nedum. under the presidency of the rutel heau, for the
purpose of communication on all subjects connected with the general and local interests of the
chureh. In these conferences, doubts might be removed, and information and advice inter—
changed, on whatever points, either of doctrine or practice, might occur in the course of your
parochial ministrations.”
