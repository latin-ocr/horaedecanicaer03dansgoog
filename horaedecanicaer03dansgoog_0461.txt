We constitute and appoint you by these praeents tuta! beau of a certain district
within our diocese, comprising the parishes named in the margin3 and we rely upon
your fidelity and vigilance, in observing and duly reporting to us all such things
within your blssttltt or tranet& as may be proper for us, as bishop of the diocese, to
know. We also expect that you will occasionally visit all the churches, chapeIS, and
parsonage-houses, within your nimrim and that you will report to us, or to any eccle·
siastical officer whom we may appoint for that purpose, the state of repair of all such
buildings, the state of the church-yards and burial·ground3‚ and the general condi-
tion both of these and os all other matters belonging to the church.

We likewise expect your aid and co-operation in inquiring into all irregularities
or neglecte of duty alleged against any clergyman or ecclesiastical functionary
within your district3 and in settling all disputes concerning the affairs of the church
which may be subject to our cog-nizance, or which may be referred to our judgment
and authority. -

And, finally, we trust that you 'will report to us, confidentially‚ all occurrences
which in your conscience you believe are important to the church within your

And we desire, that whenever the active duties of the office shall appear to you
incompatible with your health, or you shall find the due performance of them more
burthensome than your strength or age can well bear, that you will voluntarily
resign the office into our hands·

Given under our hand and seal, this day of

in the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred
and thirty-nine, and in the twelfth year of our consecration.
