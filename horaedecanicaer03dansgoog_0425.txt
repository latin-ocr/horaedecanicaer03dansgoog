with a conscientious care and fidelity. And therefore pity it is, that either any
disorder should happen in the manner of choosing such officers, or any neglect in
exerting those powers, which do still, both by law and custom, belong to them;
bemuse each of these hath a manifest tendency towards sinking the office yet lower
than it is already sunk, and bringing it at last altogether into disrepute and disuse;
which it shall be my business, to whom it immediately belongs, as 1 doubt not but it
will be the endeavour of our common Superior (with whom God has blessed us), by
all proper and effectual methods to prevent.

Permit me therefore, brethren, to discourse to you in such measure as the time will
allow of, concerning the name and title, the antiquity, nature, and extent of this
office; to say somewhat also of the powers and rights which belonged to it formerly,
but have since been lost by misuse; and somewhat also of the present powers with
which it is invented, and of the great reason there is to preserve and employ them.

The office is very antient, though not under the present appellation of bean τῑιταῐ,
but that of attbtprtibpttu of which there were two sorts, the urban and tutal. The
urban atthipttsbytoet was originally the same with him whom we now call the bean
ot the tamental tbutdu the tutat attbsptaesbmtt was he whom we now style the
tuta! bean, who, according to the opinion of Duarenus and Sir Henry Spelman
(authorities that we may safely follow), succeeded in the room of the tboteptsstopt,

- upon the abolition of that office in this western part of Christendom. This sort of

officer, if the text of the canon law compiled by Gratian might be relied on, was
older than the council of Agatha, celebrated in uva, a canon of which is there cited,
commanding that, at the solemn reconciliation of penitentS, adsint uetant, Le. atthi-
pttssbmttt patotbiatum, who were to have the care of examining into their offences,

and prescribing penances. But nothing of this kind is to be found in any of the ’

canons of that council now remaining. Gratian transcribed this mistake from
Burclzard, who went before him in the same attempt: and Barchard flourishing but
about seven hundred years ag0, it cannot be judged how much antienter than him
the archipresbpttts mentioned in this canon were.

The first clear account we have of these officers (as distinguished from the utban
attbfipttssbytttss, or tatbthtal beans, in the tomes of the councils) is, 1 think, (A.D.
ucoca), when they were established by a canon of the council os Pavia in Italy3 the
words of which are these 2— -

‘⁴ Pmpter assiduam crya populum Dei curam singulis plebibus attbtpmbptmss
proeesse volumus, quinon solima imperiti vulgi sollicitudinem ⁸qsrant, veriam etiam eorum
presbyterorum qui per minores titulos habitant vitam juyi circumspectione custodiant,
et qud unusquisque industn'd divinum opus exerceat episcopo suo renuntient, &c.'’

This oenon was recited afterwards in termini& and confirmed, by a council at Rome,
in the year noocclv. So far is it from truth, what a late author¹, in his Paroclu'al
