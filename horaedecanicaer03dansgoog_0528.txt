As the whole Island of Man, constituting the episcopal diocese of Sodor and Man,
contains only seventeen parishoe or kin-ks, and the bishop is resident within his juris-
diction (in the administration of which he is aided by an archdeacon and two vicars·
general), there can be little call for beans rutel. But there is evidence, in Arehdeacon
Wilkins’s C C. M. Β. et H. (Vol. 111. p. 10.), of their existence during the episcopate of
William Russel (A.D.uccc1„). The Constitutione-⁸ Synodales Sodorenses notice the
institution, in the chapter De sepulturd; and it is probably again adverted to in that De
oedficio iq: solo ecclesiae. (p. 11.) Bishop Short informs me that the office of hean-
tuta! has not been re-established in the Isle of Man3 but that he has had some
thoughts of reviving it= in which case, according to Ιιίε view of the ruti-hetam!
nonnum, the commis-vion should proceed from the archdeacon. (oct. 2. uncccxmu.)
