xxxvn. 1f you observe any priest, or church-servant, coming into your jurisdiction
from another diocese without a passport, or living there longer than the prescribed
time by the pessport, or serving and performing sacred duties without authority, you
are to present such a one to the spiritual authorities, or to the consistory. And you
are to direct your priests and church-servants to give you information respecting such
persons.

xxxvm. You are not ιο allow unemployed priests, or church-servants, to officiate.
But if the real incumbent is ill, dies, or is absent; if he is deprived of his gown, or
sent away by authority: in such cases only, you may nominate unemployed priests,
or church-servants, to the performance of their sacred offices for a time; and present
the person you nominate, for the information of the authorities.

xxxix. If a priest, deaoon, or church-servant die, you are immediately to report it
to the consistory, for their information3 and if a priest, to represent it also ιο the
diocesan. In the mean time, you are ιο propose ιο the parishioners to select a proper
person (ιο fill the place); and to send a petition (sor confirmation), attested under
your hand. And if they do not proceed to the election of a priest in the course osa
mouth, and ιο that of a deacon or church-servant in the course of two monthS‚ you
are without fail to represent it.

ιι.. You ought to be present, without doubt, at the election of a priest. The
election is to take place in the church, in the presence of all those who belong to it,
as well as the more respectable of the parishioners. Aster prayer, and an invocation
of the grace of God, let them choose a person worthy of such an office; honourable
in his mode of life, according to his turn, and one to be preferred amongst those who
are educated (for the profession). Therefore you, O &lagotbtnnoh are to exhort the
parishioners to select a person of such qualities= but if no person, with such qualifi-
cations, belongs to that church, then they are to select one from other churches, or ιο
leave it ιο the discretion of the bishop. You are, O Blagotbtunot, to countersign
their petition= both ιο certify the sig-naturas of the parishioners, as well as prove that

the election has proceeded according to due order.
xm. At the induction of a priest to his living, the letters of orders and institution

are to be read by you, Ο ἶβίαςοώειιηοί, in the church ιο which he is inducted, on ·
Sunday, during Divine Service, from the Ambon. Other letters (or documents) are
ιο be given to the parish-priest, to read. ¹

mr. You are continually to insist, with the priests and church-servants, that they
educate their children honestly; that they teach them reading and writing, at all
events, when they are seven years old. After having taught them the rudiments, they
are to send them ιο the schools. And if any of them are beyond the above-named
years, they are to look for places sor them, and not to allow them to live idle: but if
any remain idle, beyond twenty years of age, you are to present such, after your exa-
mination in reading, chaunting, and the catechism.
