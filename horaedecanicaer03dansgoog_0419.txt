The foregoing rules continue to be acted upon, with slight alterations and
additionS, in the archdeaconries of chichester and Lewes (Nov. mncccxuu.) In the
latter jurisdiction, Archdeacon Hare informs me, they have adopted, from the Sarum
tepitulat regulations, the rule empowering tbaptttss to depute members from one
thapltt to another, and have already found the advantage of it. And the archdeacon
has further recommended, that, at each chapter, inquiry should be made how far the
resolutione entered into at the preceding mtttfing or matinga have been carried into
effect, and with what successu as also that members of a thapttt, who may be pre·
vented from attending a mating, be requested to 0811 011 the tutal bean, that they
may inspect the report of the proceedings and may leam what were the principal
matters brought under consideration.

Mt Brevi-:anun Β80111811,

“ Ι succosa ιο you the copy of a circular lately addressed by me to the tural litans of your
archdeaconry, proposing a plan for the improvement and extension of their office, and t‘or the
more effectual promotion of many Christian objects of local as well as general interest throughout
the diocese. These objects will appear sufficiently from 8 perusa] of the address itself, and
will require no further explanation at my hands: but, being fully convinced, that, without your
cordial support and co-operation, they cannot be perfectly attained‚ 1 am anxious ιο commend
them earnestly ιο your kind and serious attention, and ιο entreat all the assistance in their be-
half which you can bestow consistently with your parochial avocations.

“I am, your faithful Brother,

The mral limus have been holding their thaptzrs throughout the diocese of chichester5 and in
811 of them we understand the predominant feeling has been the most sincere regret t‘or the loss
of our late worthy diocesan. Resolutions indicating this feeling have been passed at all of them,
distel-ing, of course, in words, but agreeing in sentiment. We subjoin one which we have
obtained from the 111181 'omum contiguous ιο Brighton: -—“ Resolved unanimously‚ that we
cannot proceed ιο the ordinary business of our ruti-Banna! thamuz until we have expressed the
deep sorrow which we feel, and must long feel, for the loss of our amiable diocesan, Bishop Otter,
and offered our sincere condolences to all the other thapttrs now assembled on his suggestion
and under his authority. We cannot forget that we owe chiefly to his zeal, activity, and wisdom,
the formation, within the short period of his episcopal rule, of our Diocesan Association for
Church Building and Clerical Aid‚ our Diocesan Board of Education, and our Diocesan Training
School. But the occasion of our present meeting requires of us to record more especially his
beneficia] enlafgement of the office of tura! bnans—an office revived in this diocese by Bishop
Buckner in 1812; continued under the sanction of Bishops Carr and Maltby3 but very lately, as
the last legacy of his pastoral and parental care to the diocese over which he had so faithfully
and affectionately presided, called into full tupitulat efficiency by Bishop Otter, whose memory,
on account of the many persona] as well as official virtues of his character, we must ever hold in

respect and reverence.”-—Br=‘9hton Gazette. 2
