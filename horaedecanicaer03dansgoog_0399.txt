sur. Dran,

Ι nncmvssn your letter3 and am already sensible, by the many complaints made
unto me by the tuta! beans, that there have been irregular invasions of their rights,
profits, and liberties: but Dr. Wainwright, my chancellor‚ came on Satur-day last
before me, and declared, and promised in the presence of many witnesses, that he
would not at any time hereaster intermeddle with the jurisdiction of any the tuta!
utana of the diocese of chester, or prove or take conusance of any will or wills not
exceeding in true value 40l. So that Ι conceive the jurisdiction of the tuta! bean&
will be distinct and secure from further invasion: yet, that Ι may answer yours, I have
thought fit to declare, that in the grant of my patent of the principal registry, dated
the sixteenth of August nncnxu„ to Ralph Morgell, Jervace Fuller, and John
Tibbols, gent„ it was never my intent to injure the b'15rick by infringing any of the
rights os the tuta! Βεειιβς nor is my meaning, that the said principal registers aforesaid
should intermeddle with, use, or exercise the office of register, scribe or actuary
belonging to any the Mans tuta! within the said diocese of Chester‚ or receive,
demand, or lay claim to any fees or profits arising from the probate of any will or
wills or Pres of administration, tuition, curature, compute, or quietus ωε, the inventory
not exceeding the sum of 401, or of the each os them, nor intermeddle with the ordi-
nary swearing of churchwardens, receiving any presentments, or doe any other act or
acts to the prejudice of the said tuta! Deam or any of their registers. Having signi-
fied unto you my sense in this matter,

Ι rest your loving friend,
Oct. 13, 1662. Gm. Casa-amn.

Ι desire you will comunicate this unto your thapttt.
