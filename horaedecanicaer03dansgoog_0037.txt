are excluded, or at least absent, Van Espen has the fol-
lowing fenflble remark—“Dum llae pastorum tongrega- ξ
tionts modeste, pie, ac vero pastorali zelo instituuntur, nemo 1
de earum-fructu et utilitate dubitare poterit ; fiemmum tamen ἶ
m’t ach‘umentum,st inter eos stat aliqui scientia, pietate, et
zelo eminentiore& qui juniores aut rudioreS, vel tepidiores ᾗ
erudire vel excitare queant ; fhdque authoritate et eruditione ἰ
conyreqationem diriyere ”—an advantage, which, it seemS,
would be at once fecured by the judicious selection and
well-appointed prefidency of tural mans, as prolocutors ᾗ
of these little satttflotal ztzst'onz. ;
Where no notice occurs of the pttsihents of the Inan- 2
tits acting as prolocutors, it is probable the turi-Uttanal J
office existed not. For it would be both natural and '
agreeable to established church-usage, that the heau
tutal, where found, should take the chair on fuch occa-
fi0n8, as the representative of the bi1h0p‚ and prefide over ἑ
the deliberations of a society, of which each individual ἕ
member was subject to his vicarious superintendence.
· But, to go back to the more perfect form of thapttrss
—of which the superior ecclesiastic of the district was
the official head—for the mere priestly matinga, having
nothing to do with maus tutal, must not carry us farther ι
away from the main drift of our inquiry 2—the next
branch of which is, to collect the various measureS, or ι
items of bufinesS, to which the attention of Uttanal annulis
was directed, at their different times of meeting, and to
endeavour to reduce them into some fort of order and ς

arrangement.
