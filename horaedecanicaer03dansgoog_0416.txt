fellowship, and without any commerce of gifts and graces with each other; and the
church suffers in the consequent want of confidence and co-operation. Now there is
strong reason to believe, that the eouncils recommended in our plan would have
a tendency the reverse of this. The matter sor discussion would be provided before·
hand, and entirely calculated for edification and peace3 matter, t00, os so high a
nature, and involving such deep Christian interoets as must make all petty griefs
and differences shrink into nothing, and yet so practicable, and so limited and well
defined, as to give little occasion for speculation or debate, and none for the engen—
dering of strife. The only contest among the members would be, which should
stand foremost in furthering the great interests on which all would be intent: they
would enter upon their counsels, each in his best frame of mind, their hearts having
been raised by prayer and praise offered up in unison to God, and then warmed
towards each other by the consciousness that they had been labouring together in
His service3 and they would separate with sentiments of mutual good will, and
would depart with a deeper sense os their obligation towards the church as a body,
and better prepared for the duties and services of their charge. May God grant that
this spirit of concord—the precious ointment which ran down from the head of our
Great High Priest to the skirts of his garment-be one fruit of your counsels; and
then I am certain you would need no further recommendation, and no higher reward.

Under this hope, my reverend brethren, Ι willingly leave this proposal to your
care, commending you heartily to the grace of God, which alone can give you
patience and perseverance for the work, and crown all our labours with success.
For though 1 am convinced that this measure, or one of like tendency and effect, is
requisite sor the church at the present day, in order that it may pass in safety through
the difficulties which surround it, as well as profit worthily by its high station and its
great advantages, Ι am not sanguine enough to believe that in any case the scheme
will at once produce all the good it is capable of, or that in all casas it will advance
with the same steadiness and equal steps. 1 know too well the obstacloe to which all
must be liable, and how differently you must be circumstanced in your several
districts with respect to the means you possess, and to the aids you may hope to find.
Sufficient sor me will be the assurance that the scheme will have a sair and faithful
trial with you all; and then Ι may confidently hope, that the successful example of a
few, and even the disappointments and delays of others, will finally smooth the way
to a salutar-y establishment of it by the rest. Meanwhile, it is a consolation to know
that we may all repose with confidence upon the enlightened support of the lay
members of our association, of which we have already the surest pledge: for it would
be strange indeed if they who have so liberally contributed to the foundation os our
several institutions, and who continue to uphold them now, should be reluctant to
assist a scheme, which, apart from other blessingS, is intended to give permanency
and efficacy to them all.

Before 1 close this address, Ι avail myself gladly of the opportunity of offer-ing you
