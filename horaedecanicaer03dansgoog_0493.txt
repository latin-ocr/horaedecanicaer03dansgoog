in the ‘⁸ Bn’efAccount of tlte Nature, Use, and End os the Offioe qs mean Rutale’
drawn up for the information of the clergy of his Beuum, by Dr. John Priaulx, one
of the tuta! Deam appointed by Seth Ward, soon after his installation.

The autograph of this eurious document came into my possession immediately aster
my own appointment (AD. mocccxxvn), by Bishop BurgesS, to the tuta! Damnate
over which Dr. Priaulx had presided in the days of Bishop Ward: within the pre-
cincts of which jurisdiction‚ in the parisb church of Berwick Saint John, amidst the
registers of the dead and living, the jus. was discovered by an antiquar-ian friend,
and consigned to my hands².

During about twenty years ofWard’s episcopacy, I believe the office was efficiently
kept up; and its duties performed by the under-mentioned clergymen.
