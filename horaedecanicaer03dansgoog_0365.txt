SECT. IL—Biottsc of York,

THE diocese of York contains about three-fifths of Yorkshire3 the remaining two-
fifths constituting the newly-created diocese of Ripon. It is divided into three arch-
deaconries 2—1. York, alias West-Riding—containing the hiantius of Ainsty eum
York city, and Doncaster. 11. East·Riding—containing Buckrose‚ Dickering, Hert-
hill, and Holdernoes. 111. Cleveland—containing Bulmer, Cleveland‚ and Ridall.

When my first edition was published 1 had no information to communicate re-
specting the tuti-baana! office in this populous diocese beyond what the following
facts supply from the pages of Whitaker, Thoroton, and wilkins. Dr. Whitaker
records a bean of Craven in the West-Riding, in the early part of the twelfth
century3 and a second, towards its close. (See Hise. of Graven, p. 481; and
ᾖοω Euenit& natales, Part 11. Sect. 11.) Dr. Thoroton notices the beans of
the county of N ottingham¹, formerly in this diocese, attending at the matrix· ecelesia
of southwell, in the thirteenth century, to receive chrism and holy oil for the use of
the clergy of their ὒεαητίεβς (see {Qum Rettulit& Rutula, Part1v. sect. v. c. vn.
56). Archdeacon wilkins gives a mandate os Archbishop Grenefeld, of the fourteenth
century, addressed to the official of the archdeacon of the East-Riding; wherein a
turcl bean of Dykering is mentioned (CC. MR. et H. Vol. 11. p. 424. ΑΒ. moccxm.)
The instrument is entitled, Mandatum W all. Grenefild, Archiepisc. Ebor. contra
adorationem imayim‘s Β. Viryinis in ecelesia de Foston.

To Archdeacon R„ Ι. Wilberforoe 1 am obliged for an examination of the (Rhapta
Records of York, prosecuted by himself, and for the following extracts thence made:
—Copia Confirmationis compositionis super visitationem uttan( et capituli Ebot.
AD. mcccxxvm. ‘⁶ Ec Batauus &humanitatis Ebor. et ceteri beraut mandatis uetant
ct :apstuli quatenus consuetum est pareant et intendant-''—From a §815- entitled,
“De consuetudinibus in Eocl. Ebor. &c.’' p· 66. The same thing is expressed by
Torta—‘⁸ The tutall bean of York and all other rurali beans shall likewise obey the
mandates of the bean auh dupin, as far as they are bound by custom to d0.”—York
Minster, p. 992. The archdeacon further informs me, on the authority of Mr. E. V. Har·
court, Registrar, that there are no vestiges of the ruti-betuna! jurisdiction in the
registr-y of the archbishop, beyond what is supplied by the bare fact of the existence
of tuta! Uenutius as recognised districts for the registration of wills Suc.

After a short sketch of the origin, title, and duties os beans rutel, Mr. Hunter
remarks—‘⁶ The very office, at least in the diocese of York, is almost forgotten. The
last clergyman who was bean of Doncaster was William Steer, who died in unccnv„
a prebendary in the cathedr-al church, and vicar of Ecclesfield.” And in a {bot-note
he subjoins—“ William Mirfyn was bean in mncxxxv. Postlethwaite, rector of

(¹) The Ecclesiastico! Report os AD. uncccxxxv. proposes to sever off all Nottinghamshire
from the diocese of York, and to transfer it to that of Lincoln: an arrangement which has taken
place since my first Edition,
