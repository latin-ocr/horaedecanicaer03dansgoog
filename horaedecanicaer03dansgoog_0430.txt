disturb it by new models and schemes‚ which they think may be of more service.
But when a main branch of our ancient ecclesiastical constitution bath been dropped
by a gradual disuse, no man’s modesty needs restrain him from interposing towards
a revival of it. And that is the case of tura! Beana and thamam which is no new-
fangled device, but an institution (as you have heard) of venerable age, by long
experience approved, and practised with greater influence and success in this than in
any other part of Christendom. We are sure, therefore, that it is well adapted to our
constitution, · and would be so far from intersering‚ that it would fall-in with the other
parts of 1t, and even contributa to support and strengthen them; and enable those
who in an higher sphere hold the reins of ecclaeiaetical discipline (too long and too
much slackened) to guide them to better advantages than they do, or can do at
present. This, I am sure, was the opinion of those who, aster the reformation of the
doctrine, were employed to draw up what was necessary towards completing the
discipline of the church; and to that end compiled the Reformalio Legum Eccle—
sia-sticarum, wherein the chapter of bruni} tuta! (which 1 recommend to your perusal)
contains a very full and particular account of their office, as it was then intended to
be restored.

When this project proved abortive (for what reason they may easily guaes, who
consider how ready some men have all along been to blame the defecta of our
church·discipline, and how unwilling at the same time to supply them with proper
provisions, lest they should want occasions of complaining); Ι say, when this scheme,
in which the civil power was chiefly concerned‚ took no effect, the ecclesiastica!
power did what it could to set things right by authority of convocation. And among
the canons framed sor this purpose, one in unnxxr. shews how sensible the then
bishops and clergy were of the usefulness and importance of the bean tutal's office,
about which they thus determined :—

“Peracld visitatione, archidiaconus siynficabit episcopo quos invenerit in quoque
Bttauatu ed doctrina et judicio praedilos, ut ἀίφιί sint qui pro concione doceant
populum, el praesint aliis. Ex iis episcopm potest electum ficere, quos volet esse

Here ιε no account given of the several powers and duties belonging to this eccle-
siastical officer· two particulars only are mentioned—That he should be well qualified
to preaclz and to yovem But good preaclzers tlwn, ιιι the insancy of our Reforma-
tion (when many illiterate men were of necessity to be ordained) being not to be
found in every benum, the character and power of this officer lessened every day;
so that the Convocation of unclu. (which fixed that body of canons whereby our
church is now governed) appears not to have entered into any measures towards
restoring it.

It hath been endeavoured indeed to promote the same end by other mea-ns, with
which our constitution is wholly unaoquainted3 namely, by a voluntary erection of
societies for the reformation of manners. Far be it from me to condemn the zeal
