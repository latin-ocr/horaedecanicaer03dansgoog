(¹) The former might, perhaps, and for the most part, be called, in the
language of the ecclesiastical courts (of which, by the way, Ι must plead
dunqualified ignorance, and therefore ought not to venture to use), the
¹ voluntary5 and the latter, the coutentium jurisdiction of tuta! tbapttts.
Voluntary jurisdiction, in the author’s meaning, would extend to such
matters as are transacted without any solemn process of judicatum, in a
deliberative rather than a judicial court; such as are contained in the
following two chapters, viz. cc. 11. and 111. Contentious jurisdiction
implies a judicial power, in the court which exercises it, to enforce its
enactments by penal inflictions of some kind or other z—such matters
are contained in ce. 1v. v. vr. vu. v111. 1x.;‘ while, again, cc. x. x1. would
fall under the former, or voluntary division. But the author is afraid
to put forward terms‚ of the use and application of which, elsewhere, and
’ξ by wiser heads (φωνᾶντα συνετοῖσιν), he is so prosoundly ignorant. He
would not ostentatioussy affume an accuracy, to which he well knows he
has no real claim. The terms, therefore, where they occur, he hopes
will be mercisully dealt with.
