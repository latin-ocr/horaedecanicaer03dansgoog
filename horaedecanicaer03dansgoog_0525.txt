SECT. XXVI.—Biotoese of wortestet.

THE diocese of Worcester¹ consiste of the counties of Worcester and Warwick,
which constitute two archdeaconries 2—1. Worcester; within which are nine tuta!
mantica—Worcaeter, Blockley, Droitwich, Evesham, Kidderminster, Powick, Per-
shore, Warwick, and Kineton. 11. Coventry, containing four tuta! Beanries—Arden,
Coventry, Marton, and Stonely. means tura! appear to have been very aerly insti-
tuted in this diocese. In the days of S. Wlstan (AD. mxcm), or even in those of
S. Oswald (pecccatum), it may be inferred they were in existence, from the following
extract from the Acta Synodi Wyornensis of the former prelate, relating· to the
exemptious of the monastic churchoe: ‘⁸ Anno tertio conversionis Wynsii presbyteri,
beatus Oswaldus prioratum ei super¹ monachos sanctoe Elenae ecclesia· concessit,
assensu reyis Eadgari. Concessit etiam illi omnibusque suis successoribus, prioribus
hujus ecclesiae, decanos esse super omnes ecclesias suas et presbyteros,· ita videlicet
quod nullus decanus, nullus archidiaconus de monachorum ecclesiis seu clericis se
intromittat, nisi per priorem ecclesioe omnes ecclesiasticas consuetudines prior sicut
summus decanus episcopi pro suis ecclesiis episcopo reddat, &c.'' (CC. M. B. et H.
Vol. 1. p. 370.) The notice is an interesting one, as it gives to the prior the title of
chief dean (ff the bislwp, the tural bean, at his first institution, being called the dean of
1!oe bishop. While, again, if the facts here appropriated to S. Oswald are to bear the
date of his episcopate, it will carry back the tuti-betuna! institution to an earlier
period than we have before assigned to it; viz. to the reign of Edgar, instead of that
of Edward the Confessor. See 32. B. R. Vol. 1. p. 86. The comitantiam of Bishop
de Bleys (AD. mccxxx. and A.D. mccxx1x.), enter fully into the services performed by
beans tuta! towards the clergy of their Metinates. (CC. M. B. et H. Vol. 1. pp. 570--1,
and pp. 626--7.) And those os Bishop de Cantilupe (AD. uccxn.) are equally con-
firmatory of the important station of these Officers in the diocese, and of the trust
reposed in them by the diocesau. (CC. M. B. et H. Vol. 1. pp. 671, seqq.) The pas-
sages have been already cited.

The Valor Ecclesiasticus Heurici VIII. notices one solitary bean tutal in the diocese

of Worcester, in these words—‘⁸ Betanatus de Powycke D'nus J oh’es Rycroste betam&
tutal’ ib’m.” Valor. Eccles. Vol. 111. p. 237.

(¹) The alterations suggested by the Clam-clu Commission ot‘nncccxxxv-·v1.,in reference to
this diocese have, 1 believe, been carried out in full.
