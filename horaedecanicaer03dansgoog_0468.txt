peace as are zelous in religion, and favourers of the gospel and state, are to be
moved and required, to help and fortify their lawful proceedings; to be present at
their solemne assemblies and preachings; to their better encouragement, and the

good example of the common sort.
And whereas there hath been a solemne order of long time commonly observed‚

that every Sunday a publick sermon hath been used and frequented in the Greenyard
in Norwich; it were very convenient, that these §upttluttuhmlm having open warn-
ing of their days appointed at the synod, should, as it were in course be called, to
supply that place: not onely to testify to all the world, and to make manifest to the
enemies of the truth, the uniformity and consent in religion; but also to confer with
the bishop and his chancellor, touching the several scrolls of every hesum, exhibited,
as before3 to impart unto them of the amendment of the former abuses certified.
And to take both order and courage to proceed in the same or other accordingly.
And whereas now the usual synods are gathered together only, as a briday‚ to set
and spend their mony, (the synod-mony not commonly received then, but committed
over to the registers at their pleasure otherwise,) these §uptttutmhtntffl whom the law

termeth testes synodales, assembling and meeting there, and having countenance of

minister, or other person whatsoever, after his often private or public admonitions,
should not amend and conform himself, he might there be rebuked, or suspended,
before all the clergy of the diocoes, and the whole congregation there assembled; to
his speedy amendment, and the example and terror of others. Where also the
bishop or his chancellor, being advertised by conference with them of all disorders,
might give present order sor redress. And for the undoubted fears of maintaining
schismes and factions in prophesyinys, if they were established, or preachings other-
wise, these supnluttnhmtss, being conformable men, are to be appointed moderator-s

Of ffgdzehrgzz law hath plainly forbidden, that process out of the court should be

awarded to be served by the adverse party, or any of his assignment, whereof we see
by daily experience the inconveniency3 for that the adversary, keeping the process
by him, will await such time and business of the party, that he cannot appear, and
often such slender returns are made as bear no credit: it were greatly to the further·
ance of justice and indifferent dealing, all process should be directed to the stipatu-
ttuhtuts in their several maurita, by their officers to be executed, and returned
authentically according to law. Whereby the subject shall have no cause of grief 3
and justice better may be executed.

If it be objected, that the usual courts of archdeacons should hereby be abridged3
nay, the lawful authority of archdeacons shall be renewed and established3 and their
unlawful usurping‚ to the great charges and trouble of the country, restrained3 and
law duely exercised without corruption. Besides, that this office of supermanant is
presumed by common law to be joyntly at the bishops and the archdeacons appoint-
