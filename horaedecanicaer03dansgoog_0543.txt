THE diocese of Clogher consists of the counties of Monaghan and Permanagh,
and small parts of Tyrone, Donegal‚ and Louth. Whether the diocese was of old
divided into tuta! utenti& or not, Ι find no notice in Ware. From an inquiry,
kindly prosecuted by Precentor Darby, of Ossory, through the dean of Clogher, I am
informed‚ by the registrar‚ that there are no ancient forms of betuna! commissione, nor
any vestiges of the existence of beans tuta! previous to the year uncccxxn.; at which
period the diocese was divided into eight districts: viz. l. Clogher. 2. Enniskillen.
3. Drumkeeran. 4. Irinismacsaint. 5. Monaghan. 6. Ematris. 7. Ballikea. 8. Clon-
tibret. Commissions have been since issued, from time to time, by the present
bishop, as circumstances required. I subjoin copies of the Commission and Queries
directed to each tuta! bran, to be answered and transmitted to the registry, before
each annual visitation‚ when all the returns are entered in the visitation—books. The

names of the five tuta! Beana now in office are given in Robertson's Clerical Reqister
for the year uncccxuv.
