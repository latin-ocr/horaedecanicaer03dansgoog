booles, wherein the names of certain clergymen, who were appointed over certain
nimrim, are recorded; such entry serving as their title to the office. No acts of the
tuta! Beana are ever registered3 nor do these officere seem ever to have been vested
by commis-vion with any vicarial or other official authority which would call sor public
registration.

Whenever any extraordinary inquiry, however, as to the state of parisheS, parish
officere, &c. δια, is made by the Government or Ecclesiastical Commissioners, it ie
through the tura! Beana that the bishop obtains the required information.

The Clerical Reyister of the year unoccxuv. states the tura! beans of Tuam to be
six, of Killala four, and Achonry two. The names of the officere are also recorded.

THE Episcopate of Scotland is early mentioned in the valuable tomes of Arch-
deacon wilkins (CC. M. B. et H. Vol. 1. p. 36); and the sees of her many bishops
are enumerated by name (p. 495, and elsewhere); but we look in vain among his
church-records of the first twelve centuries for any traces of brana tutal, as helpmates
to the Scottish prelacy in the administration of their diocaees. The geographical
limits which marked the jurisdiction of the ancient diocoees have been broken up in
modern dayS, and new episcopal districts formed. It ie from the records of some of
the elder sees alone, as far as they have been made accessible to me, that the following
notices of the tuti-betuna! administration of Scotland have been extracted ¹.

Archdeacon Wilkins tells ue, in a note to the fourth volume of the Councils of
Great Britain and Ireland, p. 206, that the diocoee of St. Andrew’s was divided into
eight tuta! maurita, or at least that there were eight turni Beana concerned in its
administration. The earliest notice which he gives us of their connection therewith
is (AD. mccx.) inethe ‘⁴ Charta confirmationis J ohannis Cardinalis in ‚scotia et Hibernia
legati, de ecclesiis monachorum de Chelcho infra episcopatus Sancti Andreae et Glas-
guensie :'' where it is ordered that the procuratione to be paid hythe presented clerks»,
or perpetual vinata, to archdeacon8‚ beans, and othere, at visitation, shall be regulated
by the Lateran Council under certain limitatione here expressed. (CC. M. Bet H.

      
     
     
     
       
     
         
     
       

(¹) Although I have no doubt of rutal 'utana having existed in every diocese of Scotland up to
the time of the Reformation, still, having no actual proof thereos from ancient recordS‚ save in
' the following dioceses», Ι have not thought it necessary to appropriate sections to those sees which
afford no immediate evidence of Πιωῐιὶιῑ government. The names of the unnoticed sees were,
Aberdeen‚ Argyle, Brechin‚ Caithness„ Dunblane, Orkney, Ross, and Edinburgh3 the last

having been erected by our martyr-king.
