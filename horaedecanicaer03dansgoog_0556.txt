by the archdeacon of Connnr, in virtue of a commission from the bishop, durante bene-

The Lord Bishop of Down and Connor, and Dromore, as soon as he received my
letter of inquiry as to the tuti-betuna! administration of his diocese, caused search to
be made in the registriae, and forwarded to me, without loss of time, the annexed

and King‚ for the year uncccxmv„ enumerates seven tuta! beans in Down‚ nine in

Connor, and seven in Dromore.
