Antiquary‚ that the archdeacons deprived the Uenus παπαῖ
of the probate of wius, and Archbishop Langton of the
cognisance of matrinwnial cuffes. There is nothing to
lead to such an inference 3—-for before there could have
been a spoliation of right, there must have been a legal
and canonical commifflon of such caseS, in yeneral, to
their jurisdiction3 and this does not appear to have
been the case. On the contrary, it is more than pro-
bable, that tutal munz, in exercifing these acts at all,
except by special delegation (in some places growing

into custom), had themselves¹ overstepped the limits of ⁶

their office—“falcemfitam in alienam meffem mittentes,” in
the words of a canon of Laval (AD. Mccxm.)——and had
become usurpers of other men’s privileges», and, as such,
called sorth the many canons, with which the councils
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries abound, for
coercing them within the acknowledged bounds of their

camng.

Warm, however, in support of Betanal prerogativeS,
and a zcalous advocate of the judit-iaz character of tutal

(¹) It is widem, from ΜΓ. Prynne's numerous extracto from “the
Wkite Tower ” recordo, prohibitor-y of touttss-thtisstlau encroaching· upon
the rights and prerogativee of the crown, that Deam tuta! did intermeddle
with matters tempora] beyond their lawful jurisdiction. The following
vrit of attachment and proces& iffued (Heu. ΙΙΙ.) to the iheriff of Lin-
coln, for instance, ihews that usurpation, and, at the same time, the extent
of the power of the btau’ss toutt :—“ Quare} secuti fimt placitum in ειιτίίἰ
