To the Right Reverend Father in God, George, Lord Bishop of Chester.
Oua very good Lord,

We, the bean and ὦψαι of Chester aforesaid, being assembled in our chapter-
house, have, this eleventh day of October, received a patent or grant, under your
Lordship’s episcop. seal, dated sixteenth August uncum, granted unto Ralph
Morgell, Jervace Fuller, and John Tibbols‚ gent„ during their lives and the life of
the longest liver of them, of the office of the princ¹. registi-ar and scribe in the diocese
of Chester afores⁶. together with all the ffees, profits and emoluments whatsoever,
belonging to the same, only excepting and reserving the rights and profits which by
law and custom do belong to the register or reg'. of all and every the respective
tuta! hune of the said diocese—humbly conceiving that by the words towards the
close of the said patent, viz. (“ J uribus et emolumentis registrariorum et actorum
scribarum omnium et singulorum bttanatuum tutal. dioec. Cestrien. pro tempore
existen. in singulis, negotiis per Batauos turam} et scrib. sive registrarios praed. de
jure et consuetudine expeditis vel expediendis infra dictos betanatuss semper salvis ''—)
there is not a sufficient provision made for the right of the registers of the beant}
tuta! by patents already granted by your Lordship’s predecessors, or hereat'ter to
be granted by your Lordship or your successor-s, bishops of Chester, or the respective
beans of the said tuta! benum& and unless your Lordship be pleased to declare to
us, in writing, which we may enter upon record in our chapter-book for the informa-
tion of successioni, what rights, liberties, and priviledges, your Lordship doth intend
unto the said registers of all and every the said respective tuta] Mauras, and what
limits and bounds your Lordship doth intend to put upon the said R.M., J.F. and
J. T„ so that there be no future interfering between the officers of the said distinct
registers, we cannot in prudence confirm the said patent, as foreseeing the principal
registers aforesaid (under pretence of we know not what concurrent jurisdiction they
already begin to talk of) will daily be invading the rights and profits of the said
tuta! δίεπ’ registers, by which the said tuta! beans will be disabled from paying the
pensione of the archdaecons, which by your Iard's'p'. discourse unto us yesterday
seemed to be your intent and purpose, as it was the practice of your predecessor&
Bp Ferae, Bp Walton, and Bp Bridgeman, who thereby eased the bishoprick of
Chester looL per annum—which, by reason of some trespasses already made in that
kind, the Deam} tuta! profess they will fling up their patente, unless they may be
secured hereafter from the like invasions. We have therefore, by joint consent, sent
this bearer, Prebend Charles Duckworth, to bring unto us your Lordship’s Declara-
tion and Resolution in the premises, which we desire with all speed.

My Lord, your Lordship's most affectionate friend, and humble servant,
Hm«. Eumaeum, Bran.
