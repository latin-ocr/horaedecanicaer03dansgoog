The earliest notices of beans κατεῖ, within the ecclesiastica] territory constituting
the diocese of Chester, are found in documenta of the twelfth century; at which time
it formed part of the dioceses of York and Lichfield. The beans of the different
beanda were then appointed by, and were subject to, their respective archdeacons.

On the erection of the see of Chester by Henry VIII. (down to which date the
office appears never to have been extinct in the archdeaconries of Chester and
Richmond) the constitution of the charge was materially changed. From being
terminable at the will of the archdeacon, it became perpetual, and was leased out for
lives; as the following documents (for which my readers are under obligation to the
Lord Bishop of London, and W. Ward esq., the deputy-registrar of the diocese)
will shew.

The hiantia of the diocese of Chester are distributed under other jurisdictions in
the Valor Ecclesiasticus Henrici VIII. (the see not being then founded); but the
beans themselves are not noticed. The “ Diym'tas ”transtila de Leyland” is said
to be “ in manibus Will'mi Knyght Archi’ni Cestrie.” See the printed ναῖον Eccles.
Vol. v. p. 231.

So much has been said on the betanal jurisdiction of this populous diocese in the
foregoing pages‚ and so much will hereafter appear, in the annexed patents and
other documents of institution of utana tutal and their subject officers, that Ι need
merely ‘add, in this place, that the office of tuta! beau⁴ of all the uzancia is now

exercised by two persons; the archdeacon of chester, and the commissary of Rich·
mond. ‘⁸ Their authority as tuta! beans? the bishop of London obligingly commu-
nicates‚ “ is of very ancient date, and in some of its branches is quite independent of
the bishop. The archdeacons of Chester and Richmond, as such, have no jurisdic-
tion whatever.”

„2le30ss of the annexed patents were granted subsequently to the consolidation
