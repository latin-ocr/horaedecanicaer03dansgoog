Spelman‚ as 1 have before pointed out (ἶῐᾷ. Ξ. Β. Vol. 1. p. 53, and note), derives
the title of tutha (barbara contractione) from that of chorepisstopus, and seems to
consider the office the same with that of betanus ruralis, plebanus, and attbipttsbnttu
in which view he is sustained by the united authorities of Isidore Moseovius, Sir
John DaviS, and Usher. But the precise meaning of the term tumbert· (pronounced
totnotb or turbe), Dr. Todd remarks, it is very difficult to unravel. ‘⁴ Sometimes the
word is used nearly in the sense of successor-¹, as when a bishop is said to be the
tombatb of the first founder of his see; in which sense the archbishop os Armagh is
the tombatb of St. Patrick: and the same in the case of abbots, as the tombatb of St.
Columbkill,” διο. “ But besides these,’' he adds, “ there seems to have been another
sort of tombatb in the Irish church, who appears to have held a kind of office not
unlike that of the ruta! bisbopss or ruta! beans?

Ι am informed by the Lord Primate’s private secretary‚ the Rev. Alexander Irwin,
that ‘⁴ there are no entries whatever in the registries of Armagh‚ nor any official
documents‚ on record, respecting tuta! beans? I have myself looked through Arch-
bishop Usher’s Visitation-Boolc in quest of such memoriale in vain. “Archbishop
N ewcome, on his appointment to the see of Armagh,’' Bishop O’Beirne informs us,
“ not only revived the institution os ruta! beans in his own diocese, but strongly
recommended it to his suffragans.” (Sermone and Charye& Vol. 1. p. 230.) At the
present time it exists‚ and is most efficient, in this diocese, under Archbishop Lord
J. G. Beresford, who himself appoints to the office without any formal instrument
durante beneplacito.

The archbishop holds a visitation of his provinces of Armagh and Tuam once in
three years; a visitation confined to Armagh diocese on the year following his pro-
vincial visitation3 and a confirmation every third year. This is the cycle of his
duties as regards visitations‚ &c.; and the tura! beant} are employed in procuring
information preparatory to each, the archbishop sending to all the beans of all the
dioceses the Articles of Inquiry hereafter given. The tutal beans of this diocese are
also the centres of exertion in behalf os the Soce‘etyfor the Propayation ‘ff the Goepel
in Foreiyn Par-ts, and the Charch-Education Society sor Ireland.
