accumulate, fan the latent spark with gentlenesS, give it proper fuel whereon to seed,
and it will soon break forth in all its wonted brightnoes. Our brethren, it will be
found, are not like the bones of the valley seen in the prophet's vision, where all was
‘ very dry’; on the contrary, ‘ a noise' has been heard, ‘a shaking’ has been among
them, they are alive and stirring3 as yet, perhaps, too much divided3 but let the call
to union be made—let it be raised by the voice of authority—let it be sent out in the
spirit of love—and they will ‘ come together,’ we may hope, instinct with warmth and
life, ‘ as an exceeding great army,' compact and strong, ‘ fair as the moon, terrible as
an army with banners!

‘⁶ Is it that we are not aware of the dangers which surround us? While they that
oppose us are all consederate, well knowing the strength which union gives, are we
crying peace, where there is no peace—slumhering at our posts, and unwilling to
league together in defence of our common safety ἲ Neither is this the case: all
appear ready3 all would unite; the danger is clearly seen3 there wants but the way
marked out, the needful discipline enforced, to enable us to meet it. For it is not
that we have no polity to bind us together, to supply us with that strength which
unity is so well fitted to secure= we have the most perfect which the wisdom of man—
or, rather, a better wisdom than that of man—ever devised; we have an ecclesiastical
polity, scriptural in its basis, admirable in all its parte, and adapted to every exigency.
The church is immensely superior to dissent in its education, influence, wealtlu num·
bers, but, above all, in its polity; yet how has dissent, without any thing like the ad-
vantages we possess, increased around us by well organized and systematic activity;
what a sront has it shewn3 what a standing has it attained; whilst we, with all our
advantage& are behind-hand, from want of union and co·operation. We are either
ignorant os the privileges we possess as churchmen, or we know not how to use
them, or, at least, we do not avail ourselves of them; and so our adversaries sor a
time prevail.

‘⁴ In thinking how this state of things can best be remedied‚ how union may be
promoted, and all the many blessings which result from union be secured, 1 have
been naturally led to inquire into the ancient usages of the Catholic church in fur-
theranoe of this desirable object, both in our own and foreign countrieS, and to see
whether any facilities of clerical intercourse obtained among our forefathers which
have been denied to ourselves: or whether the defect of communication, of which we
now so generally complain, be not attributable to the church having allowed her
institutions in support of ministerial union to fall into disuse and decay. While
looffing back upon these things, Ι have been brought to the recollection of those
ancient meetings of the clergy, denominated betuna! or tuta! Φερίας. These sgnum
are, as you know, among the elder institutione of the church, and for many centuries
were generally prevalent in this country as well as the continent. The best autho·
rities inform us that throughout the dioceses of England and Ireland they were ae-
customed to be held as osten as once every three weeks, subsequently once a month,
