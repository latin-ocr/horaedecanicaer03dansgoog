Lincoln may the more regularly and sully be informed of the state of such portion of
our diocese—We therefore constitute and appoint you, by thoee presente, to be a tuta!
bean for the parishes mentioned in the margin of this present instrument, during our
pleasure, requiring of you punctuality, care, diligence, and accuracy, in inquiring,
observing, and reporting to us, or to our archdeacon aforesaid, all things relating to
the churcheS‚ chanceIS, churchyards, and to the glebe-houses of non-resident incum-
bents, and their fences and enclosureS. And in order that you may be prepared to
make the said reporta to us intelligently, and upon sure grounds, we do especially
desire, charge, and empower you, on our behalf, as does also our archdeacon, whose
sig-nature is subjoined, to visit personally, once in the year at least, every church,
chapel, chancel, church and chapel-yard, glebe-house, and glebe of non-resident
incumbents‚ and their fences and boundaries; and to leave in writing, attested by

appearing that the archdeacon has assented to appointments, which abstract from him a long-
exercised authority on the subject, he is desirous of your opinion ³,

‘⁴ Whether the bishop of Lincoln has the right to appoint these tuta! bnans P or whether the
office has», by usage or otherwise, devolved on the archdeacon, so as ιο require his assent
to such appointment P And, above all, whether the rector of Shenley is bound, canoni-
cally or otherwise, to submit to these new functionaries in the several matters mentioned
in their circular P ’'

“I think the bishop of Lincoln has power and authority to appoint mul litans. It is not the
creation of a new office, but the revival of an old one. For tnta! beans were well known to the
ancient ecclesiastica] constitution of this country, although the office in later days fell into
desuetude; and even in the century preceding the Reformation, was reduced to a shadow and a
name.

“ Dioceses were divided into archdeaconries and tntal Utanritz. The archdeacons took their
titles from the district, which was generally the county; whereas the tutal litans were appointed
for each hundred.

“The functions of archdeacon can in no way be affected by the revival of the office of
tura! heau. This office is wholly independent of theirs; it is especially characterised by the
exercise of the visitatorial power, to which the tural 'nean is wholly incompetent, his function
being that of mere inspection; and it is expressly laid down by Bishop Gibson, Vol. ii. p. 972,
that ruta! litans can have no concern in parochial visitations.

“Undoubtedly, if we are ιο judge from the circular letter, the tuta! beans seem disposed to
push their authority to the utmost extent; but still, as long as they confine themselves ιο mere
inspection, 1 am of opinion that any interference on their part could not be resisted with effect:
and as their inspection may be of assistance to the bishop in the general administration of the
affairs of his diocese, it would, Ι think, be inexpedient and unadvisable ιο offer any captious
opposition ιο their proceedings.

*ι “Mr. Newcome does not obJect to ‘inspection,' but ιο annual written quei-ies and written
replies. By possibility he might be helping to erect a new authority, and thereby furnish
evidence against himself. Let the churchwarden testify to the incumbent’s conduct, and the
incumbent to the churchwarden'S, if faulty.
