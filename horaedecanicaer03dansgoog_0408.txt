seems especially to have engaged his attention; and to him we owe one of the first
attempts at a revival of the ancient ruta! tbaptets—meetingS, that is, of the clergy, held
from time to time within the limits of their ecclesiastical divisions‚ under the presi-
dency of the respective beans, such as seem to have obtained in this diocese as far
back as the early part of the thirteenth century. The following letter, addressed ιο
the tutal Beana of his diocese on the first formation of these capitular matinga, by
Bishop Otter, will be read with much interest by all who are concerned in the adap—
tation of ancient institutions to modern days; while it is the best earnest that Ι can
give of the heartfelt conviction of a good and learned prelate (who had made it his
duty ιο study the subject with accuracy in all its devolopment) as ιο the practical utility
of the turi-huam! §afilem in that department in which it has been hitherto more
particularly neglected, viz. chapter-boloiug in the beandas.

Mv Rsmsrm Basrnasn,

WnsN you were assembled with me in the beginning of last month, 1 read to you
the outline of a scheme intended for the improvement and extension of your office in
the service of our common Master and Lord. On that occasion your attention was
chiefly directed to the Board of Education, which, at a public meeting at Brighton‚ has
since been happily placed under the charge of the Diocesan Association. But other
particulars were then briefly noticed 33 coming within the scope of my intentions:
and I now submit the whole plan to you in a more formal shape, in the hope that,
with the benefit of your judgment and experience, it may grow hereafter into an
uniform and regular system of decanal administration throughout the diocese, which
can scarcely fail of affording essentia] aid to the bishop in the discharge of his duty,
and, by the blessing of God, may be the means of diffusing the graees of Christian
union and benevolence more widely among the members of our church.

The measures 1 have ventured to recommend are distinctly set forth in the sug·
gestions appended to this letter. The substance of them may be comprised in a few
words; namely, that, according to ancient usage, you should convoke the members of
your tuta! Φερίας, ι113ι is, the clergy resident in your several beandas, once at
least every quarter‚ and consult with them respecting the best method of carrying on
the great work of the ministry within your districts, and of promoting everywhere
the interests of Christian faith and charity‚ under the sanction of the church: and
further, that, after every quarterly meeting, you should report to the archdeacon, for
the information of the bishop, all such results of your deliberations and inquiries as
may appear ιο you important for him to know.

It may seem perhaps, at first sight, that in making this proposal 1 am seeking to
increase a task always without emolument, and already burdensome enough3 but
this, 1 trust, will not be the case. The burden will be lighter‚ by being shared with
others: and when Ι consider what great good the scheme is capable of producing,
