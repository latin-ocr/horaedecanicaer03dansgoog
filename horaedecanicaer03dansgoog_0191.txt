eth. That when that part of the canon-law obtained, there was a .
saving to the different customs of several places; as appears by the gloss
referred to by the Lower Houfi, in their third reason. And, therefore, if
this epistle did not in its fullest authority overrnle those customs‚ there is ἱ
much less reason that, after it has been long out of use, it ssiould deter-
mine the Convocation ιιι their measures os establissiing, de nove, tuta! ’

‘’th. The archbiihops and bisslops in convocation afl'embled,mn1,xx1.,j
did not think themselves bound by it, when, in the chapter‘ ‘Archidia-
com? ’they express themselves thus .-“ Peractd visitatione, archidiaconus
stymficabit episcopo, quos invenerit in quoque betuniam ed doctr-ind et
judicio praeditos, ut diqni fint, qui pro concione doceant populum, et
praefint aliis. Ea: illis episcopus potest electum facere, quos velit effe ’

eth. Nor did it hinder the eouncil os Trent itself, as little favonrable
as it was to the order of biihops, from going farther than this, when
they were pursuing the matter of reformation‚ and decreeing, Sqffi 24.
ekapss. in these words:—- “Archidiaconi autem, uetant, et alii infe- ἔ
riom in iis εοεῐεβε, ubi, kactenus visitationem exercere leqitime con-
sueverunt, debeant quidem, qffumpto notarie, de corffmsu episcopi dein· ξ ’
οέρε per seipsos tandem ibidem ms tare }

ι 9th. The Lower House do not seem to think themselves bound by ἶ
that papal decree, to which they refer, when they suppose, ιιι their request l
subjoined to their reasons to break ιιι upon those customs which obtain ff
in those places where tuta! beans are found,‘ m order to make them, j
according to the direction given in her Majesty's Letter, still more usesul, ἶ
where they are.

For if they think, and it may be very rightly, that those customs,
which were saved by the gloss upon that canon to which they refer, may !
be altered by a new constitution sor the improvement os the state os the i
ehurch3 they cannot reasonably pretend, that the bissiops are not at
liberty to propose a new constitution sor the establilhing tuta! mansa
where they are not, different from that papal decree which has been so
long
