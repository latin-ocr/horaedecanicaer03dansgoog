i The Upper Houst: ofConvocatio‘n have considered the reasons offered

by the Lower Hmfit sor their disagreeing to the amendments made by
, the Upper Houfi in the fourth paragraph os the paper relating to tuta!
{uenum end think them not sufficient to induce thie Hense to recede from
the same amendments, for the following reasons: (May 1602, unocxl.)

. 1st In the first reason of the Lower Hotqse for disagreeing to the said
amendmentS, it ia alleged that the bisslops have agreed that the said tuta!
beans shall be appointed jointly by the biffiop and archdeacon, and from
ε thence infer that they ought to be displaced jointly by both; whereas, in
Ι this very paragraph, it appears that the tuta! Beana are only to be recom-
1 mended by the archdeacons having jurisdiction, and appointed solely by
Ι the bissiops, under their hande 3—so that the foundation of this reason being
laid upon a mistake in fact, the reason grounded upon it cannot but fail.
2⁴1. It appears from the second paragraph, as amended by the Lower
ξ Hmfie, that the tutal bnans, when appointed, cannot perform the arch-
, deacon’s part in visiting churches etc„ without a particular commiffion

        
        

 

    
     
      

 

      
 

*from him; and, consequently, that they are not immediately, by their
’ appointment to that office, ministerial both to the bissmp and archdeacon,
i nor therefore intituled, upon that account, to hold the same, until they
Ι meu be displeeed jointly by both. And therefore,
ε 3d. The decretal epistle os Innocent 111„ which proceeds upon a
Ῑ general suppofition that the tuta! hanff have equal relation to the
bissiops and archdeacons, and thereupon provides that they should be as
well placed as displaced by both, is not applicable to the present case,
J wherein the constitutions proposed have made another provifion.
ι 4th. The decretal epistle is os the least weight3 for being written at a
Ι time when the popea made it their business to leffen the authority of the
bilhops, sor the increase of their own; and for being the fingle ground
l os those gloss'oe which afterwards followed, agoeeable to it.
f 5th. That of what weight soever it might be, while any tuta! Beana
ξ subsisted here upon that soot which that decretal epistle supposes, it can-
* not in the least oblige ua to govern ourselves by it in a new establissunent
