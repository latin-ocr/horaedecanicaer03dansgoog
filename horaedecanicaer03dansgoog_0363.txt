walion, to the archdeacon, for the reasons alleged. But, two years afterwards, we
find, in another document preserved by Mr. Somner in the same Appendir, N⁰. mx„
a saviuy clause, introduced by Archbishop Wethershead—“ proelzabito consilio nostro ’'
—on the occasion of his formally continuing to his archdeacon, Hubert, the “ institu-
tiones et destitutiones hctanotum.'’ The words are these: ‘⁶ ..... Intuitu probitatis
moe et sincera (fictione quam circa personam ipsius yerimus, haec ei personaliter
concessimus, sine omni prejudicio Cant. ecclesiae et successorum nostrorum, institu-
tiones, viz. et destitutiones betsuotum, praelzabito consilio nostre, &c.” Α. D. Mccxnx.

An historical anecdote of a beau tuta! os Canterbury, during the primacy of
Robert Winchelsea, at the close of the same century, is related in our earlier pag-es.
See Part 1v. Sect. ιι. I}ut, in the year nocctxxvu, 1 conceive, the institution had
fallen into disuse. The mandates os Archbishop Simon Sudbury, then issued for
the visitation of the diocese of Canterbury, take no notice whatever of Beana tutsl
in connexion with the uersantes there particularly enumerated. (CC. M. B. et H.
Vol. 111. pp. 111, 112.)

The temporary delegation above granted to the archdeacon personally (supported
by the authority of Pope Innocent’s rescript, issued a few years before), led, in aster
days, to a plea of proecription being set up by the archdeacon of Canterbury against
the archbishop. I allude to the circumstance os Archbishop Sancroft, when he
would have revived the office of bean tuta! in the diocaee os Canterbury, being
opposed, in the nomination of persons to fulfil the charge, by Archdeacon Parker.
See Somner's Appendiae to the Antiquities quanterbm-y, pp. 65, 66. and his remarks
on benus tuta! “ in the general,” under “ Ecclesiastical yovernment os tloe city‚”
pp. 175, seqq.; Prynne’s Papal Usurpations, Vol. 111. p. 9873 and Brett’s Churck
Gom-ament, p. 188.

'Hie ναῖον Ecclesiasticus Henrici VIII. records the various usauria of the diocese,
but notices no officers, as presiding over them. There were, therefore, at that time, no
bians tuta! within the diocese: nor am I aware of any having subsequently existed,
until the office was very recently restored (ΑΒ. mcccxxxm.) by the present much-vene-
rated primate; whose annexed Commission and Instructions for the tuta! benna of the
diocese of Canterbury sufficiently explain the constitution of the office as it now obtains.

Iam happy to be able to lay before my readers three tuti-betuna! seals of this
diocese; viz. of the betsameth of Sutton-Valance, Dover, and Ospringe—Sec {Rota
