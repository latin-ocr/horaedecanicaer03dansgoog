Armagh3 vie. Aughnacloy‚ Dungannon, and Cookstown. The archdeaconry of
Armagh is co-extensive with the diocese3 but the archdeacon, as such, has not any
jurisdiction over the tuta! beans.

The learned Dr. Todd‚ of Trinity College, Dubliu, to whom Ι am obliged for much
valuable intelligence, as well as references to sources os information not generally
accessible‚ touching the office of tuta! bean in Ireland, states it to be “ his impression‚'’
in which I entirely agree, “that the office was introduced there along with the papal
yoke in the l2th century.¹ In the early Irish church‚’' he says, “there does not appear
to have been any such functionary, although it is very probable that the office was dis-
charged‚in part at least, by the amatha? and tombaths, or tethea? of whom Ι have already
given a few brief notices in Vol. 1. pp. 53, 54, and Vol. 11. p. 15. Some further curious
remarks on these ancient ecclesiastical officere, supplied by spelman, by the fore-named
learned antiquary, and others, are subjoined, which the reader‚ who is interested in such
inquiries, may compare with the above references. They came before me too late for
insertion in my earlier pages‚ where they would have been more appropriately introduced.

(²) The prime duty of the Hermachs, or ΕνεηαοΙιε, was to take care of, and administer for ec-
clesiastical purposes, the carmon-landes or charon-alebas, the inhabitants and cultivators of which
had an hereditary right of occupatiori by episcopal licence, as long as they paid a certain fine,
and duly contributed to the repair of the mother church. ‘⁸ His terris atque ipsis colonis‚”
writes Sir H. Spelman‚ ‘⁸ praefectus est ea· assiynatione Episcopi Her-machus .· qui et munus ob·
tinuit archidiaconi ee nomen. Ver-noculo? enim emcmueacb et Omcbmoeacb (quasi archidiac.)
nuncupatus ese.- ee ἀ munere archidiaconus esse cayno-scitur. Non autem superioris generis,
qui hodie sub episcopo jurisdictione ,ἰν-υἱέω- .· sed antiqui illius, qui presbytero inferior, pauperes
et Xenodochia (diaconias inde appellata) curabae.'' The dependence of the &tremebam upon
the bishop, and its hereditary nature, are clearly shewn from two documenta in the registry of
the see of Armagh, entitled ‘⁴ Concessio &strumas ὰ Milone Armachano Archiepiscopo facta
An. Dom. ucccnva’ and “ Confirmatio Hes-enacim haereditarie possidendas, facta ὰ Johanne Mey
Armachano Archiepiscopo A n. Dom. mccccnvl'

To the same effect writes my learned Irish correspondent of Trinity College, as to the origin
of the title διο. “The word creasti) is a corrupt spelling of the Irish word arbtcannad), often
spelt altoeanrmtl), and pronounced, as nearly as possible, nenati). Itis compounded osam, hiyk or
chief, and teau. a head5 acl) being the adjective termination: so that the word may be repre·
sented in Latin by archicapieala‘s. It was applied to a bishop in relation to his chapter, and to a
bean or abbot in relation to his canons or monks: but of late, perhaps since the twelsth century,
when the Roman supremacy was admitted, it came to signify an officer who had the care of relies
and precious consecrated things belonging to a church or diocese ;—and in this sense the office of
nenati) was hereditary. And this part of the office is still kept up by the peasantry in many parts
of the country; although the Romish church in ,Ireland has never availed itself of this portion
of the customs of the primitive Irish church. There are, ιο this day, many curious ecclesiastical
reliquaries‚ and cases of books, bells, croziers‚ διο. in the hands of the hereditary descendants of
the ancient amatha of the different dioceses ; and it is almost impossible to get them to part with

such relies, from the superstitious sear of being visited with some divine judgment for so doing.”
