there is a remarkable passage in his comment, where he inquires, whether the beans
of the archbishop's peculiare (as Shoreham, Croydon, dcc.) can by custom have cogni-
zance of matrimonia! causes. To which he ariswers, they may3 and gives this reason
for it, beoeuse those brana have archidiaconal jurisdiction, being subject to the arch·
bishop alone, who deputes them, “cum tamen caeteri uetanti rurales eliam (ut com·
maniter) subsint archidiaconis.'' And to the same purpose speaks Atho's glossary
on the Legatine Constitutione of Otho :—“ Tam profici debent berani rurales quam
etiam amoveri per episcopum et archidiaconum simul dc jure ='’ he adds indeed
‘⁶ salva consuetudine locorum,'' because, in some places, the mandate sor the choice
of brana rutel doth, by the bishop’s grant, proceed from the archdeacon alone, as in
the diocese of Canterbury: in others, fr0m the bishop and archdeacon jointly; i. e.
from the bishop through the archdeacon‚ as in this diocese. And from all these
authorities, that skilsul and accurate civilian Dr. Cowell collected this definition of a
besu rutel, which he gives in his ‘⁸ Interpreter,” and is transcribed by Godolphin ’
into his “Repertorium .·’'

‘⁴ A person having ecclesiastical jurisdiction over other ministers and parishes near
adjoining, assigned unto him by the bishop and archdeacon, being placed and dis·
placed by them.'' He means, by their authority, but at the instance, nomination,
and election, of the clergy. Nor is it unworthy of observation, that a canon in
smum. (the only canon of our church which, since the Reformation, mentions beant}

v rutel) joina the archdeacon with the bishop in the steps that are to be taken towards

choosing them. 1 forbear to recite the words here, because 1 foresee Ι shall have
occasion to use them towards the close of this paper. ,

How and when the archdeacon came into a fixed share of authority in this matter,
appears from a rescript of Innocent 111. in the year uccxxv„ inserted into the body
of the canon law. “anlptcsbptoetiss' says he, ‘⁸ qui ὰ pluribus Dttani nuncupantur,
archidiaconi jurisdictioni se now-int subjicerc.'’ And in answer to an inquiry then
made of him, ‘⁴ Utrum uttan( tutela qui pro tempore statuuntur ad mandalum
episcopi solum vel archidiaconi, vel etiam utrimque institui debeant vel destitui, si
fuerint amovendi .·” His determination there is, “ Ad hoc breviter respondemus qudd
cum ab omnibus quod omnes tangit approbari debeat, et eiam eorum'’ (i. e. of the
bishop and archdeacon) ‘⁴ ”etatum <fficium exerceat, communitio- εει etiam eligendus
vel deponenda-'3’ Ever since this rescript, the archdeacon's authority bath intervened‚
together with that of the bishop, towards appointing brana tutal, except where by
grant, composition, or custom immemorial, things have been otherwise ordered3 as
the case is in the diocese of Canterbury, where, thirteen years aster the date of this
rescript, Stephen Langton, the archbishop, granted to his archdeacon the institution
and destitution of Beana τιιτεῑς and for this remarkable reason :—
