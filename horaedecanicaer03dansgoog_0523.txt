for commoner purposes; while others for weightier matters were convened every

three months. Both classes os §anob were concurrently held in each &anabaud were ⁴

attended by all the clergy, whether beneficed or not, within its precincts. They were
usually congregated at the house of the ruta! bean, who opened the proceedings of
the thapttt with prayer, either at home or in the parish church, followed often by an
appropriate discourse. The archdeacon was frequently present at them, and acted as
president ofthe thaptet. After awhile, and by degrees, the more frequent montblg
mmings began to fall into disuse, and were eventually absorbed in the larger quat-
tetlg assstmffltts, which continued to be regularly held up to the time of the Refor-
mation, when they seem to have been lost in the archidiaconal visitation courts.

“I am one of those who think that great event was productive of immense blessing
to this country. The church then purified herself of much that was sadly dark and
unscriptural as to doctrine, and shook off many ceremonies which were superstitione,
burthensome, and unprofitable 3 but she also departed from much that was wholesome
in point of discipline: and I believe, that, in proportion as we search out the practices
of our forefathers in this respect—as we stand in the old ways marked out for our
guidance, and submit to those ecclesiastical rules of government from which the¹
reformers never meant we should depart—we shall find ourselves‚ under God, com·
pact and strengthened.

“ Allow me now to point out some of the many advantages which, as it appears to
me, would accrue from the revival of those betuna! matinga to which Ι have just
adverted. Supposing them to be held, as they have suggested in whose opinion
Ι confide, and as my own judgment approves, periodically-say once in each quarter,
with the exception of that in which the annual visitation takes place—they might, and
probably would, under the Divine blessing, prove of great and permanent advantage to
the diocesan, to the clergy, to the archdeacon, and, through them, to the church at large.

‘⁴ l. To the diocesan—and 1 trust there is no presumption in the thought—it surely
would be satisfactory to every bishop to know that at certain seasons his clergy
would be found assembled regularly together: that at such times he might, through
his archdeacons or ruta! beans, have an opportunity of proposing to them any
important questions that may ariae, and of collecting their opinions. It is true the
power of communication between the bishop and those committed to his charge is
open—and, in this diocese, open, as we have reason to know, in the freest manner3
but it is, aster all, the conference with the individual, not with the body. At present
our diocesan has no stated periods at which he can consult with us collectively‚ and,
by means of a well-organized and certain method of communication, receive the
sentimenta of his assembled clergy. And here let me state, that, previous to calling
you together on this occasion, I did, as in duty bound, consult with our bishop on
so important a measure3 and, Ι am happy to be allowed to say, 1 have his lordship's
sanction for giving it a trial, and his best wishes for its success.
