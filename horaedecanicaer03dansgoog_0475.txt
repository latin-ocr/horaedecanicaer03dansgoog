SECT. xlx—metm of wrfotn.

THE diocese of Oxford ¹, comprising the enunties of Oxford and Berks‚ is divided
into two archdeaconries 3 viz. 1. Oxford; containing the tutal beanda of Aston‚ Bur-
coeter, Chipping·Norton, Cuddesden, Deddington, Henley, Oxford, Whitney‚ and
Woodstock. 11. Berks3 containing those of Abingdon‚ Newbury, Reuding‚ and
wallingford.

Bishop Secker, in his Fifth Charye to the Clergy of Oxford‚ notices “the antiquity
of the useful institution of tuta! brana, its continuance from before the Conquest till
the great rebellion. and its restoration afterwards in several dioceses, and particularly
in this of Oxford by the admirable Bishop Fe11.” See Secker's Charyes, p. 185.

Ι cannot carry back the betanal history of this diocese beyond the days of the latter
prelate; whose method it was, according to White Kennett, to ordain tuta! Beana, by
oral declaration, at his times of visitation. “ The last so nominated”by this “excel-
lent judge of men and merits,” ‘⁸ in the heaut& of Burcester, was Mr. Samuel Black-
well, B. D. then vicar of that church3 who (as an exemplary supervisor of the clergy‚
and a diligent assertor of the rights of the church) had been duly qualified for the
office, if it had continued in all the dignity and authority of its primitive institution.”
See Εὖ. Ξῠῦαιῦα, Parochial Antiquities, Vol. 11. pp. 358, 370.

In the interval between Bishops Fen and Secker, the office, probably, was dormant,
or the latter prelate had referred to its uninterrupted exereise, as an argument for its
continuation in his own days z—instead of which, he merely says, “ Ι should be glad,
with your approbation, to set it up once more amongst us, in such form as might be
most beneficial and satisfactory: but contented at present with hinting the matter,

1 leave and recommend it to your serious thoughts.” See Secker's Fufia omme,
AD. muccun- Charyes, p. 186.

Bishop Seeker was soon asterwards translated to the archiepiscopal see of Canter-
bury; and, it may be, never matured the appointment adverted to. But of this Ι
speak diffidently, having received no communication from Oxford on the subject of
my inquiry, save the following form of commission. It is the instrument now used
in the appointment of Draus tuta! by Bishop Bagou who revived the office four
'ears ago·
³ To the circumstance of this revival the bishop alludes, in his Charye addressed to

(¹) It is proposed hythe Char-oh Comminion (AD. uncccxxxv.) that the diocese of Oxford
shall be increased, by the addition of the county of Buckingham, from the diocese of Lincoln,
and of Berkshire from that of Salisbury. The latter county has been transferred.
