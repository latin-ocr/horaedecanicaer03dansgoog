THIS diocese consists of Roscommon, most part of Cavea, parts of Sligo, Galway,
May0, and Leitrim; and small parts of Fermanagh and Longford. Ware tells us of
many peculiarities about the see of Kilmore: “ It has neither cathedral, chapter, canons,
or prebendaries. . . . The archdeaconry is ambulatory, and hath no corps ; but the bishop
annexeth that dignity to any parish, at his discretion. Ardagh is united to it.''—
Harris's Ware‘s Worlcs, Vol. 1. p. 225. There is no account of the tuta! beautless of
Kilmore; but those of Elphin are enumerated, Vol. 1. p. 627.

The apostolical Bishop Bedell took measures to restore beatus tuta! in the diocese of
Kilmore, AD. uncxxan. by enacting, in the 5th and 6th statutes of its first
diocesan synod= “ v. Ut secundum pristinam et antiquam hujus dioeceseos Kilmorensis
constitutionem in tribus ejus regionibus, tres Bataui sint, ab ipsis ministri-2 ejusdem
betanatfis eliyendi, qui vitam et mores cleri jugi circumspectione custodiant, el ad
episcopum reserant, ejmque mandata accipiant, et quoties opus erit, per apparitoren'i
betanatstss ad compresbyteros suos tramittant.

‘⁶ νε. In quovis titanum, in oppido ejus principali, autentus sive tupitulum sit
ministrorum quolibet saltem meme, ubi lectis plene publicis precibus concionentur per
vices sine longis precibus et prooemiis.” CC. M. Β. et H. Vol. ιν. p. 538.

From the above date to the present time 1 have no facts to communicate connected
with the betuna! government of this diocese. No reply to my letter bf inquiry ad-
dressed to the bishop of Kihnore has reached me: but 1 have seen, in the church-
periodicals of the day, that the office now existe in the united dioceses of Kilmore,
Elphin, and Ardagh. (Nov. mncccxuu.) Indeed, the Clerical Reyister of Robertson

and King records the names of ten rutel ῦιεῐιβ in Kilmore, four in Elphin, and five
in Ardagh.
