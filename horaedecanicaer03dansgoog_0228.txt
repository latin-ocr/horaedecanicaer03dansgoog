ς). mm. vol. n. (¹ )‘ ‘Must those who profess themselves Christians,'’ says Bp. stilling-
p ‘¹⁹¹' fleet, “look at nothing in the worship os God beyond what is plainly

ε necessary? It can never be proved necessary to salvation to have paro-

* chial churches well built, or decent pulpita or pews in them; or to go

ζ to those churches in a more orderly dress than they fit in at home, or to

. have the Psalms set to the best tunes, or to have their bibles handsomely

ι bound; yet there is such a becoming decency in these things as argues
that what relatae to God and his worship ought to have something above
what is barely necefl'ary; and as to give to God no more than just what

χ is necessary, is as is we thought we had a hard bargain os it, when we
were required to serve him. Shall ingenuousness, gratitude, generosity,

' beneficence‚ have no influence on what relates to the public worihip of
ὲ God in the world?'’
