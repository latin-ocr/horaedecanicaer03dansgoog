Having briefly explained, in his gloss upon tapftulfs {firfflffifefiu-
ruralibus, the difference between the terms tupitulum,
convenae-5, and coUeyium, in their proper canonical accep-
tation, Lyndwood enlarges on the occasional meaning of Ι
capitulum, propounding, in the course of his disquisition, j
the nature and character of rutel thaptttz, and their}
three-weekly and quarterly meetings. “ Quandoque tapt- ὲ
mlum ponitur‚” says he, “pro collectione plurium, et non ξ
communiter viventium, sed ob tractatus communes inter fi*
habendos ad aliquem locam confluentium: . . . . secandumj
quem modum collectio rectorum, vicariorum, et aliorum<=
tironem ecclestasticorum ob hujusmodi tractatus communes‘
inter Je habendos etiam dicitur capitulum—Et quia ut
commun-iter hujusmodi tupitula celebrantur in locis minas
inflynibus, viz. in rure constitum, hinc est quod tupitula
ruralia dannan—Et horum tupitulotum quaedam tenentur
de trz'bus hebdomadis in tres ,· quaedam semel in quarta

over the latter. “ Afterward, upon the revival of the civil, and promul-
gation of the canon law, sufficiently replete with light and directions for
doeiding of doubtex, and determination of causes, without need either of
synode or thapttts, they began by little and little to decline, or at least ε
not to be of such ordinary use for the hearing and ending of causeS, J
(such especially as were only civil, and not criminal) as before3 and j
then, as a more easy and speedy way of dispatch, the confistorial form of :
judicatum, which we now retain, exercised by officials, chancellors, corn-
miffariae, and the like ecclefiastical judgeS, came into request; of whom, ’
in this nation, until about Pope Alexander the Third's days, no mention
at all, in any record with us extant at this day is (Ι take it) to be ²
found ;''—an opinion supported by Bissiop Stillingfleet, in his Ecclesiastical ,
Casta, Vol. ι, p. 14¹7. l
