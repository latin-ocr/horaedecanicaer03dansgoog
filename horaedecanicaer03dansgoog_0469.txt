ment, unless the custome and prerogative of the bishop be otherwise. Which *is to
be proved by continuance above three hundred years, by antient record, without
interruption, only to appertain to the bishop of Norwich. Whereby the archdeacon’s
right is shut out, in appointing himselfjoynt with the bishop= howsoever he be in
law a common officer of both.

And whereas probates of wills, and granting of administration, as matter of civil
law, are therefore committed to the queen’s disposition and j urisdiction3 for that the
law presumeth the bishop‚ for his profession, to be a man of that conscience; and
for his wisdom a man of that policy and care, most tenderly to provide for the state
of widows and orphans3 their parents and husbands so deceased: the corruption of
the officers hath been such, and the greediness of registers so intolerable, that men
of these countries;, presuming for a little mony thereupon, have not feared‚ either to
suppress the testators true will, making him dy intestate3 or to alter and forge his
will after his decease. For that the officers, one greedily snatching before another,
without due examination or consideration of the circumstances either unawareS, or
wittingly, through corruption, prove these wills by a proctor. Whereby the party
deemes himself to have taken no oatht and therefore may do what he list, as most
free. For remedy whereof these §upntnttuhtnts might do great service to us, if any
should dy within their benum, to send for the minister, or some of the parish‚ to
examine the truth of the will without alteration3 or the occasion of his dying
intestate.

Which all might be very well done at their assembly at prophesies, or preaching
every month or fortnight. Whereby all those which otherwise of devotion would not
pet-adventure frequent those exercises, might upon occasion of necessary business do
it. Then the supttlnttuhmts, upon tryal and knowledge, taking the parties oath, to
forth it to the officers, there to be proved accordingly. This one service of the supet·-
iutmhmts would stay infinite suites.

And whereas the strength and comfort of God’s people consisteth in mutual love,
peace, and amity, how many wrangling suites of defamation, tiths, and other causes,
shall his wisdom and discretion cut off, before they rise, even at home; for the per-
fect knowledge he may quickly, or must already needs have of his neighbours causes.

If it be objected, that the archdeacons may prove wills, (although by common law
they cannot‚) yet let them set down what by prescription or composition they may
truly chalengez and let every man have his own. Or let order be set down, what
value the commissary or official shall or may prove. And let them enjoy the same.
But in the mean season let not that frivolous delay hinder the course of ecclesiastical
discipline: which all good men groan for3 and without the which speedily put, an'd
wisely and strongly, in execution, the enemy will even swallow up the state.

And whereas the lewdness of apparitors, scouring of the countries; following
their masters trade and exercise; some have been detected of forty marks bribery in
