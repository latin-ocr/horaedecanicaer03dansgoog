1ο 1113 tuta! beau of Hoylande—An Inhibaion 31111 Μοπίίίοπ from the same to the

Inhibition from the same to the tuta! bean of Northampton (AD. mcccxxv.): and
lastly, A Commission of Henry Burgh (AD. mcccxxxv.) respecting revenues received
by beans rutel and others, vacante archidiaconatu.

In the reign of Henry VIII. beans rutel were in existence, though their prefer-
ments are recorded 33 valueless. The V olor Ecclesiasticus of this king notiees
many of the incumbent beans, with this report annexed—“ profic’ ejusdem betanat'
per annii . . . . nil.” Several of the utentia seem to have been consolidated 31111
113111 by the same individual, who is registered as bean of OEbtlfitlanttg of Leicester,
bean of Framland, of Goscote, of Acley, of Sparkenhoe, 31111 Goodlaxton—all, till lately,
in this diocese. (See Valor Eccles. Vol. ιν. pp. 85. 145. 149. 163. 173. 179. 182.)

Α1 1113 131131· 31111 of the following century, Bishop Gardiner complains, in his
Advice to tlte Cleryy os the Diocese of Lincoln (A.D.M1>cxcv11.) of the want of rutel
bnans. ‘⁸ Episcopal visitation,” he writes, ‘⁴ 1133 311 eye both to the clergy and laity;
but principally to the clergy, to whose cure 31111 conduct, in order to their eterna]
salvation, the laity are committed. This is 3 vast business in this large diocese, 31111
requires great diligence 31111 application of mind3 and 1 have often been much
concerned 31111 grieved, that Ι want that assistance, of which the constitution 31111
externa] regiment 31111 administration of this church has been provided= Ι 1113311, 1113
assistance of rutel beans, which office is 3 part of our constitution, 31111 13 yet exer-
cised in some dioceses of this kingdom, but has unhappily been disused in this (for
bow long time Ι know not), to the great loss and hindrance of ecclesiastica]
administration.

“ By the impartial 31111 diligent execution of this office, the bishop might be cased
in a great part of that duty, which is too heavy 3 burthen for his own shoulders.
The ignorant, the factious, the scandalous, the negligent, the dissenting, might easily
be detected in 3 3111311 Βιαιιτῃς 31111 being signified to the bishop, or rather first of
all and immediately to the archdeacon, might be timely 31111 duly corrected, 31111
reformed. For the archdeacon, inhabiting within his archdeaconry, 33 11 13 111031 pro-
per, might easily be resorted to upon occasion, and so hear 31111 amend many faults,
which might be brought to him by the rutel bean, without application to the bisbop.

‘⁸ If 3 bishop os this extensive diocese was provided of active and faithful persone,
in the several hauries, which retain the name, yet his business might be manageable,
31111 1113 authority 31111 government useful; whereas, for want of these, no bishop here
can do so much and so well as he might be willing 31111 glad to d0.”
