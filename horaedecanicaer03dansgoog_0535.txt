With a view to prevent the heavy charges for dilapidations on glebe-houseS, by
securing regular attention to the small repairs, as they become needful, the following
was approved by the archbishop osDublin, in the absence of any legislative improve—
ments on the present Dilapidation Laws :—

“That once in three years (the rutel brana continuing their annual inspectionS, as
heretofore,) the diocesan should specially appoint‚ by letter, the tura! heau and two
other clergymen (not necessarily belonging to the same braum) to examine minulely
into the state of the glebe·house8‚ being furnished with a list os instructions prepared
by an experienced builder or architect.

‘⁴ Their report to appear in the visitation-book of that year.

‘⁸ The diocesan, therefore, to order the requisite repairs to be completed in a limited
time.

“ The tural bran, at his next annual inspection, to be charged with seeing whether
the order has been executed in conformity with the former report.

“ In any case where it has not, the diocesan to issue aformal commi-saion, which
would be at the expense of the neglectful incumbent, and would lay the legal ground
for a monilion from the diocesan, under penalty of a sequestration for the execution
