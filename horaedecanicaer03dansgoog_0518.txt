To the foregoing documents, connected with the personal duties of beans ruta! in
this diocese, Ι have much pleasure in attaching others, having reference to their
capitular functione. It was in the year »mcccxxxvm- that the present archdeacon of

Sarum, when addressing his clergy at visitation on the subject of thtital mminssss,
first suggested the advantage which might accrue from adhering to the ecclesiastica]
divisione of the diocese in instituting such assssottations. In the following year a
formal proposal was made by him, with the bishop's sanction, sor the actual orga-
nization of rutel §anons or chaptets throughout the archdeaconry3 and they have since

ἔξω instituted, under the following regulations, with the best success, in each
anta.

(¹) The following letter accompanied the last distribution of Articles of Inquit-31, δια, prepa-

ratory to a general parochial visitation of the diocese of Salisbury by rural Draus :—
Palam, Salisbury, April 1.

“an. Am> Dan Sin—The period having arrived at which it appears to me desirable to
institute again a general parochia] visitation by the rutel beans, 1 have caused Artiolee of
Inquit-y to be printed, and have directed my secretary to supply you with the requisito number
for the parishes within your jurisdiction.

‘⁸ Ι rely with confidence that you will give the same careful attention to this important duty
which has already proved so useful in the administration of the affairs of this diocese.

“I remam, Rev. and Dear Sir,
“Your faithful friend and brother,

“ E. Snuu.”
