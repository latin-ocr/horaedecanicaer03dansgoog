Prayers having been read by the tuta! bean of the district,

The archdeacon of Sarum opened each of the primary tbaptm throughout the
mantin of his jurisdiction, with a brief introductory summary of the reasons and
objects which had induced him to convene the meeting. The following address may
be considered as embodying his opinions and sentiments, as then expressed and
generally responded to by the assembled clergy 2-

“ Mv Ravana-m> Bam-aman,

‘⁴ It is usual, on occasions like the present, to open the business of the day with a
few observations from the chairman3 and there seems to be more than an ordinary
propriety in following this usage when the character and objects of a meeting are of
no common occurrence, and when the person called on to preside has been the means
of bringing those present together.

“ Let me, then, after first thanking you for the kind and ready manner in which
the invitation Ι ventur-ed to make has been responded to, endeavour to explain the
motives which have induced me to take this step, and the purposes I had in view in
requesting you to assemble on this occasion.

‘⁸ Ι have long felt, and Ι doubt not it is a feeling in which all present will have
more or less sympathized, that neither as regards the laity nor the clergy, is that
social, that brother-ly intercourse to be found, which ought to exist among those who
profess to be members of one spiritual body, joined under one spiritual head, and
without which a church has but ‘⁴ a name to live ;’' without which, instead of being
one in heart and one in purpose, she is rather as a building, composed, it may be, of
stones‚ goodly and precious in themselves, but which, being without sufficient bond
or cement, is liable to be blown down by any rude blast that may assail it, or to be
overturned by the lever with which the hand of malice or mischief may attempt its
subversion. ·

“And why, we may well ask, is it thus? whence proceeds the defect of which Ι
am speaking? Is it that the church is really so forgetful of its principles, and so
unworthy of its name, that her members, and especially her clergy, will acknowledge
no brotherhood? Though open, from her apparent want of cordiality, to the charge
of being disunited, is the connexion among her children only like that of the sand,
mere contact without coherence? However it may be as to the outward appearance,
is there no warmth‚ no brotherly love at the bottom? Ι cannot believe it; un-
grateful indeed would it be in me thus to judge= when I see how I am myself wel-
comed on this occasion, and how readily our brethren have responded to the eall to
meet each other, Ι cannot think we are really so cold and distant as has been repre-
sented, Ι believe there is a warmth‚ a genial warmth below, far strong-er than is
suspected: remove the ashes which, owing to neglect or time, have been suffered to
