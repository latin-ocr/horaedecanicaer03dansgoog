deacons should read over their letters of orders, every Sunday, before Morning-Service,
at home, in their own house.

xxx. The deaconS, and others attached to the church, should respect and obey their
priest as the superior of the church3 and therefore not offend him either by word or
deed. And if they are injured by him, let them complain to you, O Βῑαςοὼεηιιοίς or
if they choose, let them present him, and wait for satisfaction.

χχχι. The priest is not to dare to injure the demon, or others attached to the
church, by retaining their income, or striking them with his hands: but if they appear

to him ιο be incorrect in their conduct, disorderly, or disobedient to him, he is to .

present them to the Blagotbtnnoi or his diocoean.

χχχιι. The prioet is allowed to punish the deacon, and others attached to the
church, in the following wayst To reprove them, first, in private, and then before the
congregation—to make them bow—the deacon at the altar, the others in the body of
the church, or in the porch-—to keep back their income, and to divide it amongst
those attached to the church, who have behaved well, or amongst the poor3 but ιο
keep no part for himself 3—and, when he has kept back their income, he is imme-
diately to inform the Blagotbtnnoi‚ and ιο await his confirmation: but if the ”lago-
tbtnnoi orders it to be restored, he is to do it immediately. If they are not amended
by their punishments, the priest is to present them to the wlagotbtnnoh who, if he
does not feel confident of correcting them, is to present them to the diocesan.

χχχιιι. The Ξῦῐαςοιῇιιιηοί is to insist with the priests and deacom, that they be not
eager of gain, or impertinent3 but that they be contented with their stipends—that
they do not demand sees for any duty from their parishioners—nor make any
compact with each other, but be contented with their free-will offerings.

xxx1v. Also, to insist that they do not impertinently go to visit a house where they
are not invited. But if they are invited, and know that the house, whither they are
asked, is an honest one, has an acquaintance and friendship with priests like them-
selves, with deacons and others attached to the church, also with well-born proprietors
of land, with respectable merchants and citizens, (they may go fthere). But they are
not irregularly to contract friendship, or familiarity, with every one. For prioets
having an holy and separate dignity, should conduct themselves suitably to it, and
thus gain the respect of others.

xxxv. You are to see that the priests, who are widowers, do not, an any account,

llzzeetp1 about them suspicions female-characters, in opposition to the rules of the Holy
a ers.

xxxvi. No priest, or church-servant, is to go to distant parishes; that is, further
than fifteen versts, without your knowledge, and that only for a short time—that his
church be not left. But you are not to allow any one to go to another diooaee
without the blessing of the bishop, and without a passport from the consistory or
spiritual authorities. And, when any one receives permission, you are to see that the
priests of other churches perform his duties, that in them there be no stoppage.
