Lichfield occur in our previous peges—some as early as the beginning of the twelsth
century (Hist. (ᾖ Crat-en, p. 481. Edit. mlo—others towards its close—and others
again in the thirteenth century. Indeed, if we may believe the proofless assertion of
Whitaker, the office existed in this diocese in the seventh century—(Hist. of Man-
chester, Vol. 11. p. 381). But of the unreasonableness of the assertion we have else-
where spoken.

1 am not aware that beans rutel—so useful as parocbial visitors in all dioceses,
and especially in large ones—have ever been revived in the diocese of Lichfield since
the disjunction of the see of Chester from it. Bishop Ryder has caused accurate
search to be made among-st the muniments of the mother-see, but has not been able
to obtain any information of such officere having ever existed within the diocese 3—
a statement which would excite some surprise (as being at variance with the known
fact of their existence before the separation referred to), did we not know that the
tuta! Beana of the archdeaconries of Richmond and Chester were exclusively the
servants of those archdeacons, and entirely exempt from episcopal rule. The arch-
deacons themselves were, to all intents and purposes‚ in their respective arch-
deaconrieS, prelates with episcopal jurisdictiom save in the points of ordination and
confirmation alone. They instituted to benefices, and performed other episcopal
acts, aided by their tuta! btanssz who had no necessary connexion with the bishop of
the diocese, but were accountable alone to their respective archdeacons, and could
even refuse citations to appear at the archiepiscopal court of York.

Thence, 1 conceive, no traces of their appointment occur in the episcopal records
of the see of Lichfleld. But, assuredly‚ this can be no bar to the revival of the office
in modern days, within the archdeaconries of Derby, Salop, and Stafford—if the
bishop and archdeacons should think fit to avail themselves of subordinate parochial
visitors within those extensive jurisdictions. That beans tura! would be found most
useful helpmates, in that capacity, to the diocesan and other existing functionaries,
1 have no doubt. (A.D. mnoccxxxv.)

Ι am happy to add (A.D.»mcccxm11.), that Bishop Butler revived the office six
years since, with the following commission and instructions, for which I am indebted
to the kindness of Archdeacon Bather, who reports very favourably of the assistance
he has derived from his tuta! utputioess since their institution.
