Sec-r.XIV.] motem of merefort. 425

It is divided into two archdeaconries3 viz. Hereford and Salop; the former of which
consists of the &attritu of Hereford, Prome, Ire-bingfield, Lempster alias Leominster,
Rome, Weobly, and Weston: the latter, of those of Burford‚ Clun, Ludlow, Pontes-
bury, Stottersden alias Sottersden, and Wenlock.

The registry-office of the diocese affords no information respecting the turi-betam!
charge. wilkins does not notice it in connexion with the see of Hereford. Nor
have Ι met with any vestigoe of it, save the names of the Decutiat& in ymzeral
throughout the diocese, in the Ter-tatio Ecclesia-stica P. Nicholai, and those of two
brana ruta! in particular within the county of Salop—the one of Ludlow, the other
of Ponsbury—in the Valor Ecclesiast. Henr. VIII. pp. 200, 212.

‘⁸ Would not the archdeacons of Salop and Hereford derive assistance in parochial
visitation from the institution of beant} rutal? The office has been beneficially
restored in dioceses of less magnitude than Hereford.” With these words my last
edition concluded; and Ι am happy to add that they have not been unheeded by the
right reverend snccaesor of Bishop Grey. Bishop Musgrave, who succeeded to the
see of Hereford AD. uncccxxxvn„ took measures for the institution of ruta! beans
very soon aster his installation3 and, when sending to me the following commission
and instructions, acknowledged that he was led to the institution of the office mainly
by the perusal of these pages. Indeed, in a more authoritative way, he observes
(Pr-imary Charye, uncccxxx1x.)—-“ Having elsewhere seen something, and heard
much, of the good resulting from the establishment of ruta! brana, my attention was
soon turned that way. Fortunately, we had no lack of persons calculated to discharge
the duties of the office. You are all acquainted with the selection made. In
a learned work, full of curious and usefnl information‚ Ι found, among other things,
copioe of the appointment of tuta! Deam, and of the instructions issued to them by
many living prelates. With the aid of these valuable hints, my paper of instructions
was drawn up. And Ι would here acknowledge my deep obligation to the reverend
gentlemen, wh0, with great labour and pains, have inspected and reported on the
state and condition of the churches and glebe-houses within their respective jurisdic—
tions. 1 trust they will yearly repeat their visits, which will every year become less
burdensome. Nor must 1 fail to express my thanks to the archdeacons who so kindly
welcomed the appointment of such able coadjutors, and to the clergy at large for the
facilities given to the inquiries of the tuta! beans. The churcbwardens, too, are
entitled to respect, for the readiness with which they (with very few exceptions)
engaged to attend to the suggestions made and to the improvements proposed.
There is great reason to hope that most of our churches will be, in a short time, as far

locally situata between the dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford, shall be added to the diocese of
Hereford; that those parishes which are in the county of Worcester and diocese of Hereford
shall be transferred to the diocese of Worcester3 and those which are in the county of Montgo-
mery aad diocese of Hereford, to the diocese of Saint Asaph and Bangor.
