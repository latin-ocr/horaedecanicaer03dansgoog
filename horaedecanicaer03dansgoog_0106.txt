'rhomamn-V-et to have any thing to do with causes mah-imonial, “ autho-
ἔα. ξἰἶέωὑῖἷ ritate proprisi ;”—the same inhibition is repeated at
{sego rom. Laval (ΑΒ. Mcch11.): “ Nffi despeciali mandato fili ponti-
Χ ⁹' ξ ficis nudatemis coquos cere vel definire proefitmant de causts
Ι matrimonialibus, stmonioe, vel aliis quoe ad deyradationem
vel admistionem beneficii, vel depofitionem eoeiqantl’ All
which things are again forbidden to Mans tutal, and
otherS, at Saumur, (A.D.Mccm11.);—where these, and
other inferior functionaries, exercising ecclesiastical juris-
diction, are charged not to employ officials or deputies;
“fi'd eoetra civitatem‚” says the canon, “ in propriis personis
suum dilv'yenter eapleant officium? The same canon pafl'ed
the synod of Langrac (A.D.Mcc1,xxv111.), and others,

cc. Μ. Β. ει Η. Again, Mans tutal are inhibited caufis mahimonial at

gaha—9¹23&- Norwich (A.D.Mcc1,v11.), unless specially commiffloned

„To'ffsdffl‘mL by the bissiop 3—at Bayeux (A. D. nece.) 3—-at Winchester
ξξιξᾷξξξξ <A.D.Mcccv111.), where the Maus are called Mans uf ibt
&cg-'¹523- j, attbhtatunz 3—at Treves (AD. Mcccx.), where the title of
ζ “ futznstss attbipttsbpttti ’' is applied to them, can. xxv· ;
1 —at Dublin (A.D.Mcchxvu1.), can. x. 3—-with many
others of later date ;—not omitting the council of
Malines (AD. MDLxx.)‚ “ cap. 111. De correctione clerico·
rum;” and the council of Trent,fi>ſj.' xxv, c. 14.

From the frequent repetition of the fame inhibition,
it is clear, says Thomassin, that the officers in question
l were continually evading the limitation, then placed on
¹. their ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and usurping the privi-
lleges of their superiors. But see the remarks of White
¹Kennett on the flean’z priority of cognisance of matri-
⁵mom'al and other causes, in the second volume of his

jParochial AntiquitieS, pp. 350, 351. and my 'subsequent
ἰ observations at the close of this fection.
