turned to account, is ever it should be thought advisable‚
in these days of eccleflastical reform, to amplify and ex-
tend the powers of Inuus tutul. Many of the suggestions

 

long out os use, if they think such new constitution more for the serviae
ε of the church.
i They do think the constitution proposed, as amended by them, best
ξ fitted to maintain and promote the good order of the church; and there-
fore infist upon their former amendment; and hope the Lower Houfie
will observe the reg-ard they shew to the archdeaconS, in agreeing to the
ἒ other amendments made by the Lower Houfit in relation to them.

And as to the request of the Lower Houst, that we would think of
some expedient, as may be most likely to procure a conformity in this
matter throughout the province; we are ready to enter into the confi-
deration of it, and to receive any proposals from the Lower Houfi about
it, that we may not only establissi tutal Beana, where they are not, but
also make them more useful where they are.

The Lower HouJe have considered the reasons which your Lordstz-ips
sent down for your adhering to the amendment made in the fourth
paragraph of the paper relating· to tuta! benum and they do humbly beg
leave to represent to your Lordships (June 5)—

lst. That where the Lower Houfi’, in their former paper, speak of the
joint appointment of tuta! nnana by the bissiop and archdeacon, their
’ ¹ meaning is not, that they ssmll be admitted to the said office by the biffiop

and archdeacon jointly, but only that the bissmp may not admit any
person, but who {hall be recommended to him by the archdeacon. In

like manner, where they speak os rutal beans being displaced by both,
their intention is not, that the archdeacon shall be joined with the biffiop
lin the act of displaeing, but only, that the said biihop may not proeeed
ξ to execute such act without the consent os the archdeacon; the authori-
tative act being in both cases equally reserved to the biffiop.

211. That as tutal Beana, by their office, have been ministerial both to
ι the bissmp and archdeacon, so they will still continue ministerial by the
present canunt and although they cannot proceed in one part of their
Ι duty affigned to them (videlicet, the vifiting of churches) without corn-
ξ miffion from the bissmp or archdeacon, yet they will be obliged, by their
'office, to execute such commiffion, when directed to them; and it is
humbly
