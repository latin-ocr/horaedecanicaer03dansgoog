groet many others were out of repair.'' Again‚ at p. 137, Dr. Goddard says of the
glebe-houses, that ‘⁶ some of them are out of repair ;’'—and farther‚ that “ repaire

ordered by his predecessor, Dr. Gordon, forty years before, had never been executed.'’
—Agaim of the clergy he says, that “ he has had occasion to represent them to the
bishop repeatedly.’'

Surely it will not be deemed impet-tinent to suggest, after this painful enumeration
of the evils consequent on the absence of parochia] visitation, that ‘⁸ where arch-
deacons are prevented‚ either by the distance of their usual residence, by the small-
ness of their income, or by infirmity, from complying in person with the canon
which requires the visitation of every church subject to their jurisdiction once in·
three years, such failure of personal superintendence, in some deqree, may be supplied
by the appointment of rura! beans?

At the solicitation of Archdeacon Goddard¹, Bishop Kaye revived the office within
the archdeaconry of Lincoln a few years ago (AD. amomum), and it appears to
have worked well. Indeed, we have the evidence of the archdeacon himself to the
point of its efficieucy, in the preface to his Charye (AD. ammonitum—‘⁸ To the
tuta! beans? says Dr. Goddard‚ “ whose efficiency during· their five years of office
vindicates the propriety of the having renewed that appointment within the archdea-
conry, Ι beg to repeat my acknowledgments. Nothing is wanting to render that
efficiency complete, but an improvement in the discipline itself.”

When the office was restored in the archdeaconry of Lincoln, search was made in
the registry for a fivrm qf'appointmem or commission ,· but none was found, nor any
document whatever relating to the subject. The following Instrunwnt (ΝΟ. 9) was
drawn up for that occasion. The office, as 1 have said, has since become general in
the archdeaconries of Stow ², Buckingbam, Nottingham⁸, and Huntingdon—that is, in

( ¹) Had the diocese of Lincoln been always presided over by such prelates as Bishop Kaye
and Archdeacon Goddard, things would not have been as above represented: such as they
are, they are uowise attributable to these active and energetic rulers, nor to other existing
officers ς they have arisen in a long series of years, from the utter destitution of parochial
visitors.(1·'eb. nnccoxxxv.)

(²) The rura! heau of Manlake, in the archdeaconry of Stow, has revived the use of an official
seal, the impress of which is the crook of the pastoral staff, with the words ‘⁴ trahit mite? within
an oval border, inscribed 4111)ae lituum ot maulam. {Rutal mans exercising voluntary jurisdiction,
bear the head of the staff only: bishops and archdeacons, having also sententious jurisdiction,
carry the staff entire—the head of which is a crook, the end being armed with a spike—

From time to time, as occasion may require, the Rev. C. Sheflield informs me, he requests the
attendance of the clergy of the htanm of Manlake in synod; and, after prayers in the church‚ a
conference is held in the vestry upon any matters which may demand consideration. He also
distributes among the churchwardens some uscful practical instructions for the due discharge
of their office: and for the use of the clergy he has printed some extracta on ritual conformity
and clerical subordination, which appear to be very judiciously made.
