observe, whether the churches receive any injury, from the want of proper ventilation,
from accumulations of earth on the outside, or from improper modes of carrying off
the water from the roof. By attention to these objects, the necessity of repairs is
frequently prevented. The same attention is paid to the state of the chancels. The
condition of the churchyards, the condition of the glebe-houseS, the preservation of
the parish register‚ the state of the parochial schools, have likewise been carefully
examined. The reports therefore of the tuta! beans have afforded to the bishop a
knowledge of his diocese, for which he cannot be sufficiently thankful. But, impor-
tant as their services would have been, had they merely supplied authentic records on
the state of the diocese, their services have been extended much further. The reports
to the bishop have been subordinate to the general plan of amelioration, which has
been carried into effect through the instrumentality of the tuta! beans. 1 should
greatly exceed the limits of this charge, if 1 described the very numerous improve-
ments, which have been made in the churches of this diocese since the time of my
primary visitation. But, in returning thanks to the tutal Beana, 1 must not omit to
make my acknowledgment to the parochial clergy in general, who have received the
tuta! Beana with unisorm kindness, and have not only aided them with the best advice,
but have cheerfully assisted by their personal attentione. Nor must 1 neglect to
express my approbation of the laudable conduct, which has been generally displayed,
both by the churchwardens and the parishioners in the several mantin, even where
the reparation of the churches has been attended with considerable expence.”

A report having reached me, that utana rutal had ceased to act in their most useful
capacity of parochial visitors within the diocese of Peterborough‚ in consequence of
some doubts being raised as to the bishop's power of constituting them, to which the
opinion of the lawyers was said to be unfavourable‚ 1 was induced to apply to
Bishop Marsh sor more positive information on that point. His lordship obligingly
replies (Feb. 24, mosomum), that tutal beans still continue to exist, though not in
such a state of activity as they were on their first appointment. Having obtained
almost all the information which he wanted. he has not urged them to further
exertions: still, they occasionally make such returns as exigencies may require. He
is not aware of any objection having been made, or any objection being possible to
the appointment itself. He has never attempted to give them any jurisdiction like
that exercised by an archdeacon; nor were they ever authorised, in his diocese, to
inquire into the conduct of the clergy. They were appointed, as stated above, to
inquire and report on the state of churches, chaneels, churchyards, and glebe·houses.
These are matters on which a bishop has a right to require information3 and there·
fore no one can have a right to object to such inquiries being made. In the execu-
tion of the office, the only difficulty which has ever occurred has been in the visita-
tion os glebe·houses. Some few clergymeu (but a very few) have considered such
a visit from the tuta! bean as an intrusion on their privacy= but they would have
viewed, perhaps, in the same light an official visit from the bishop or the archdeacon.
