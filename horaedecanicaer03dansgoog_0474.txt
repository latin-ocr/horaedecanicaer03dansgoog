the spiritual wants os the whole population. The tuta! bum has no power by his
commission to issue any order3 but it may be reasonably expected that any recom-
mendations offered by him, in accordance with the known views and duties of the
archdeacons, will be generally well received by the churchwardens, whose good
disposition towards the church Ι have seen abundant reason thankfully to acknowledge.

Much will depend on the manner in which your office is discharged. A spirit of
discretion and courtesy, it can hardly be doubted, will ensure respect and attention?
especially as the object proposed is calculated to disarm opposition, and to sosten the
objections of many well-disposed persons who reg-ard every change, even a return ιο
ancient and excellent customs‚ as a dangerous innovation.

In making the annual visitation of the churches and glebe-houaes within your
bznata, according to the terms of the commission, it will materially abridge your
trouble and that of the minister and churchwardens in each parisis, to send the
articles of inquiry for their previous consideration when you inform them of the day
and hour on which you propose to visit. You will os course request their attendance;
and you will thus find them better prepared ιο give an answer without delay on the
several points submitted to them.

The parishes in which the archdeacons reside are not to be visited by the tuta!
Ὀεαπβς and the houses of resident incumbents are to be visited only on your receiving
a special instruction to do so from the bishop in any case where circumstances may
require it. In the year when the archdeacon personally visits the several churches in
your braum, the tutal beans, or one of them, will attend him on his visitation, on
receiving from him a notice of the time appointed for it; and in that year the tuta!
Beana will not hold their own separate visitation.

If it shall hereaster be found more convenient or advisable, the parishes in your
Beatum may be divided between the two tuta! beans, each visiting a certain number3
such division to be previously submitted to the bishop for his approbation. When
in any parish you shall notice any matter connected with the order and efficiency of
the church requiring correction or amendment, you are requaeted to append a special
report of it to the articles of inquiry on returning them to the bishop, and to send a
copy of such report ιο the archdeacon ; and although such matter may not be -
specially noticed in the articles of inquiry, you will observe that the last question in
them is of a general character.

It now only remains for me to offer my thanks to you for accepting an office which
entails much trouble without any emolument; and, at the same time, to express my
anxious hope, that a measure, adopted for the single purpose of promoting the glory
of God and the best interests of His people‚ may meet with the cordial co-operation
of the clergy throughout the diocese: that, by uniting them more closely in one
uniform plan for general improvement, it may strengthen their hands in the work to
which they are called and sent, and thus afford an increased measure of assistance to
their bishop in the execution os his arduous office. For to such union and co-opera-
