Indeed the whole preamble of the canon appears to me
lto be directed against the latter, as pointedly as poflible,
'by implication, ·——because no judge is to take cognisance
of mmmye·caufi3‚ ‘⁶ per cujus simplieitatem, imperitiam,

J defects in the judicial character of the 111811 tutal, real or
{imaginary, are elsewhere alleged as disqualifying him to
