Dated, under our hand, in our palace at Wells, the second day of December, in
the year of our Lord One thousand eight hundred and thirty, and in the seventh year

of our ffimlation.

SECT. VIR—Motae of Θατῑίβῐε.

The diocese of Carlisle¹, according to Browne Willis, ‘⁴ contains the better half of
cumberland and Westmoreland, under the government of one archdeacon: viz. of
Carlisle3 which has the manti& of Allerdale and Penrith, Carlisle and Westmoreland,
belong-ing to it.''

Neither Wilkins's CC. M. B. et H. nor the Ecclesiastical V alors, afford the least in·
formation roepecting beans rutel in the diocese of Carlisle. And Bishop Percy states
it to be his conviction that the office has never existed there, no mention being found
of it in the registers of the see. In a letter, bearing date September 28, uncccxnnn,
1 am further informed by the bishop, ‘⁸ there are no tutal beans in the diocese of

Carlisle.”

SECT. IX.—Biotaest ot chester.

THE diocese of Chester includes the entire counties of Chester and Lancaster‚
and parts of the counties of Westmoreland and cumberland3 two chapelries in Den-
bighshire, and a few parishes in Flintshire. It is divided into two archdeaconries:

1. chester—containing the Uenutius of Choeter, Frodsham, Malpas, Macclesfield, Mid-
dlewich, Nantwich, Worral, Blackburn, Leyland, Manchester, and Warrington— ’
(which beanda were in Lichfield diocese till the erection of the see of Chester in ¹
mxu.) 11. Richmond—containing the utenti& of Amounderness, Furness and ¹
Cartmel, Kendal, part of Kirkby-Lonsdale, and Conpland, (all which, with others
now constituting the bishopric os Ripon, were subject, under the Archdeacon of

Richmond, to the see of York, till mnxm.²).

( ¹) The charon Commission recommends (AJ). uncccxxxvn) thatto this diocese be added those
partu of Cumberland and Westmoreland which now form part of the diocese of chester; the=
Unum ofFurness and cnrtmel in the county of Lancaster, also in the present diocese of chester3
and the parish of Aldeston in the county of cumberland, which is now inconveniently situated
in the diocese of Durham. γ

(²) It is proposed in the First Repore of the Chat-oh Commission, AD. xncccxxxv„ that the
Bantia of Amounderness, Blackburn, Leyland‚ Manchester, and Warrington, shall constitute a
new see, under the title of Manchester3 and that the mantia of Richmond, catterick, and
Boronghbridge, of this diocese, with the Utanrn of craven‚ and such parts of the mantia of
Ainsty and Pontesract, in the diocese of York, as lie westward of the Liberty of the Ainsty, and
the Wapentakes os Barkston Ash, OsgolderosS, aud Staincros8‚ shall constitute a new see, under
the denomination of Bipon-strhich has been since created). It is also proposed that the
haema of Furness and cartmel, and Kirkby-Lonsdale‚ shall be added to the diocese of cnrlisle.
But the latter mum is at present shared between the dioceses of chester and Ripon. In the
ntra Repore it is proposed that the diocese of chester consist of the counties of chester and

nine, and of so much of the county of Salop as 1321101 in the diocese of Hereford.
