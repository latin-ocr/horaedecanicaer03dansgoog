xxn. It is your duty, Oisslagotbtnnoi, to give instruction to your priests, according
ιο your own discretion, especially to those who are not very enlightened, how they
are to confess their spiritual children; how they are to bind and loose the consciences
of man, as God shall teach you in this matter.

xxm. You are to take the greatest care that your priests do not perform the
marriage-ceremony in doubtful cases; for from such proceed great difficulties and
misfortunes, ιο those who marry, and to those who are married: doubtful cases are—
when there is too near a relationship or connexion ;—if the bride or bridegroom are
not os a proper age—or if one of the parties is very young, and the other very old—
is either party are compelled ιο marry—if children wish to marry without the consent
of parents—when either party has a wife or husband living, from whom they have
separated, or who bas run away from them, or if they do not know what has become
of them—if a person wishes to be married ποι in his own parish—-if the person about
ιο be married is not of sound mind—or any similar cause ;—in any such cases you
are not, on any account, to allow your priests to perform the marriage-ceremony, but
to forbid them; and to make a report concerning the case, and to wait the decision.

xxxv. To take care, that, before marriage, three publications should be made in the

ceremony be performed, during the day, in the church‚ in the presence of the deacon
and church-servants.

xxv. 'l'hat Divine Service be performed decorously, and not in a hurry, and that
two voices be never heard at the same time; that the church-servants be correct in
their reading and chaunting: but if, after your exhortations, they continue ignorant
and incorrect in their reading and chaunting, you are to proeent them.

τινι. Henceforth, you are not to allow the institution of new processions with the
Cross, or the building of oratories, without permission.

xxvn. On holydays, at Christmas and Eastebweelss and on the day of the dedi-
cation of the church‚ the priests, with the charein-servants, are to go decently and
steadily into the housae of such of their parishioners as desire it, with the lise-giving
Cross; but they are not ιο stroll about during the night, nor to intoxicate them-
selves with inebriating liquors, under pain of a fine, not ιο be remitted.

xxvut. It is necessary that the priests should instruct the people in the church‚ on
Sundays and other holydays by reading to them during service, lately-pnbusked
Sermous3 and at MatinS, a selection from the Prologues and other holy books; also
from the Word of God, and the Catecbism, explaining it ιο the parishioners, as well
as they can. But those priests and deacons who have been taught in the Schools are
frequently ιο preach their own sermons, to the credit of their station, and the profit
of their fellow-Christians.

xxxx. It is proper to see that the priests, deacons, and others attached to the church‚
