THE diocese of Canterbury consists of three-fourths of the county of Kent
(257 parishes), and peculiars διο. (about 100 parishes), in other dioceses ¹. The
hiantia, under the jurisdiction of beans rutel, within the archdeaconry of Canterbury,
are, Sittingbourn, Ospringe, Canterbury, Bridge‚ Woetbere, Sandwich, Dover, Elham‚
Charing, Sutton-Valance, and Lympne, within the county of Kent- The peculiare ²,
as their name implies, are under peculiar jurisdiction.

Beana ruta! existed in the diocese of Canterbury in the early part of the thirteenth
century, and probably before. They are noticed as being appointed de consuetu-
dine, by the official of the archbishop; and as being responsible to the archdeacon‚
antecedently to the year uocxxvn. This appears from a clause in “ The Chapter-’s
confirmation of tlte parsonayes of Hakinton and Tenham, appropriated to tlte arch-
deaconry qs Canterbury by Stephen Langton tlze archbislrop‚” published by Mr.
Somner, in his Appendioe, N0. nx. a. ...... “ Ad hoc ciam hac-lenias temporibus
nostris de consuetudine sit obtentum qudd officialis noster betanus constituerit in
diocesi Cant. qui constituti statim tenebantur Cantuar. archidiacono respondere,
volumus et de voluntate et assensu praedicti capituli nostri statuimus, ut de coetero
archidiaconi Cant. qui pro tempore fuerint betanus constituant, et amoveant pro suae
voluntatis arbitrio profit melidis viderint capedire in dioc. memoratd, et sibi respon·
deant sicat decet, crim absurdum sit ut alius eos constituat quam is qui eis debeat
praeesse, et cui respondere tenentur, praesertim cum ipsis referentibus corrigere debent
caeterorum errata . . . .’' A. D. Mccxxvn.

The official of the archbishop, doubtlesS, obtained this power of appointing and
depriving beans tuta! (here revoked in favour of the archdeacon) primarily from the
archbishop3 who, in the cited instrument, again delegates the same, without reser-

(¹) The Char-ch Commi-§sion (AD. uncccxxxvx) suggests that the diocese of Canterbury
shall consist of the county of Kent (except those parts which are to be included in the
dioceses of London and Rochester), and of the district of Lambeth Palace, and the parishes
of Addington and Croydon, in the county of Surrey.

(²) Some account of the timus of peculiare, who are supposed to have been originally mal
luunt, will be found in our earlier pages—See ᾗ. Β. Β. Part 111. Sect. 111. And under the
diocese of chichester, 1 have introduced a curious instrument of the lituu of South-Mslling
(within the county of Sussex and diocese of chichester); who, strictly speaking, was subject
to the peculia-r jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury. White Kennett is of opinion, that
the Bran of arches was, at first, no more than the urban vesu in London‚ or the Bam ot
thtiztiauitm who had under his peculia-r district the churches exempt from the diocesan, and
under the archbishop’s immediate jurisdiction.—Paroch. Antiq. Vol. 11. p. 357.
