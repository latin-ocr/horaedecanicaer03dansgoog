THIS diocese comprehende the county of Cork‚ and is divided‚ under its once
distinct episcopates, into fifteen tuta! beandas—Cori< and Ross consisting· of ten, and
Cloyne of five nannetes. Their names may be found in Harris’s Ware’s W orks, Vol. 1.
pp. 553, 573, 583. Some of the larg-er hauries are subdivided into two districts,
as is the case generally in England‚ when they are too ⁴extensive for the effective
supervision of one functionum. There are at present seven tutal beans in CorIx,
seven in Cloyne, and three in Ross.

Ι am indebted to the Venerable S. Moore Kyle, Archdeacon of Cork, and Vicar-
General of Cork‚ Cloyne, and Ross, for the documents connected with this diocese.
He tells me that “ the institution of tuta! mantia is of ancient date, and has been in
constant operation here.'’ Probably this remark may apply to the Uscana! ΰίῦίβίοιιβ
alone, not to the offitm presiding· over them. The latter seem to have fallen into
disuse and oblivion in this as in other parts ofIreland. Indeed‚ Dr.Stock, in his Life
of Bishop Berkeley, prefixed to his Worlcs, sayst ‘⁸ He revit-ed in his diocese the useful
office of tuta! heau, which had gone into disuse= ’' p. x111.; and Mr. Hunter‚ in his
‘⁴ Beuum of Doncasaer‚'’ p. 1., remarksx “ The Bishop of Cloyne attempted the revivat
of the office in his diocese in the last century.’'
