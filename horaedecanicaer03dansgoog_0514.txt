of the said beant& to you assigned, concerning which it may be proper for us, or
useful to our diocese, that we should have information. And in order that you may
be prepared to make the said reports to us intelligently, and upon sure grounds, we
do especially desire, charge, and empower you, on our behalf, to visit personally, and
examine, once in the year, at least, every churcb, chapel, chancel‚ church and chapel-
yard, with the books, ornaments, and utensils, thereto belonging; and the glebe-

house, buildings, and lands of the incumbents, with their fences and boundaries,
’ within the said benum, according to the tenor of the Articles (ff Inquit-y annexed to
this Commission. And we further enjoin you, aster such examination made, to
leave, in writing, under your seal and signatum, an order at each place, specifying
the things which you shall judge wanting ιο be repaired, amended, or done there3
and, at the end of the said order, to require that every such paper be, by such a
limited time as you shall think proper, returned ιο you, with a certificate at the
bottom of it, signed by the minister and churcb- or chapel-wardens, that all things
are repaired and done, according ιο what is therein directed. And we also autho-
rize you, at your annual visitation, and at any other time when you may see occa-
sion, to inspect the charitable foundations, as well as national or other schools, and
parochial libraries, in connexion with the Established Church, within your Beuum,
and to supply us with such information respecting their actual state and manage-
ment, as our queries may demand, or your judgment suggest. And we likewise
give you full power to examine the licences of all stipendiary and assistant curates
officiating within your jurisdiction, and desire that you will give immediate notice to
us of any who shall officiate as curates without being duly licensed. And we also
desire you to call the clergy of your beant& together, whenever we shall appoint you
so to do; and diligently to disperse such orders as shall be sent to you for that pur-
pose. And further-more, we require you, as soon as the avoidance of any living
within your district shall have come ιο your knowledge, ιο notify the same to uS, in
order that due inquiry may be made into the state of the vacant benefice, and-
sequestration issued out of the Ecclesiastical Court. And specially we enjoin you‘
to report unto us all undue disposal of church·property in the hands of church-
wardens3 and to require, that, in every parish, a distinct churchwardens' book be
kept, and in it an· entry made of all the moveable churz-h-property entrusted to the
care of those Officers, And lastly, we desire, with the view to our being larly
supplied with the information required upon all the foregoing matters, that y will
carefully fill up, with particular and distinct answers, under the name of each parish‚
the several queries contained in your Articles of Inquiry, (with which we will* cause
you, from time ιο time, to be supplied,) subjoining thereto such additional observa-
tions as you may think needfuh and that you will transmit the same, under your
seal and signature, to us, at our palace at Sarum, on or before the first day of
August in every year3 to the intent that we may take such measures as the circum· ⁸
stances of the several returns, and the general welfare of our diocese, may require.
