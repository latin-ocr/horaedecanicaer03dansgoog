SECTION 11.

CONCILIAR Dmssss rou ‘rna Ravrvm. or ”tans Rutal.

byn &⁴3 N the continent of Europe, I have said, the
*x*

declensson of the office of Man rutal was not
>R W so marked and decifive as amongst ourselves.

“ While it was here fast perissiing away, efforts ¹
were there made, and with effect, to keep alive and give
vigour to its drooping energias, This 1s apparent, from
the dates of numerous canons and regulations cited in
the course of our OEulltttanta, and of many documents in
our fippcnhix. Though thorn by time of much of its
early consequence, it continued to survive3 and great
were the exertions made by very many churches and
councils for its full and perfect restoration13—witness
those of -Cologne A.D. Mnxxxvl. (SS. G'G'. Tom. xum), of ⁴
Augsburg A.D.Mnx1.vn1. (SS. G'C'. Tom. x1x.), of Cologne ξ
again A.D.Mnxl,1x. (SS. GC. Tom. x1x.), of Mayence
A.D.Mnx1,1x. (SS. C'G'. Tom. xva), of Treves A.D. Mnxmx.
(SS. 00. Tom. xlx), of Rheims A.D.Mn1.x1V. (SS. CC. ³
Tom. xx.), of Malines A.D. Manx. (SS. G'G'. Tom. xxm,
of Ypres A.D.Mn1.xxv11. (Stat. Synod. Yprens), of Saint
Omer A. D. Manxxm. (Stat. Audomar .), of Antwerp A. D.

Ἢ..

(¹) This restoration of beans rutal’ ιε to be understood of thei r sp zri-
tual mpacity alone, and to have no reference at all to their temporat

jurisdiction‚ which everywhere gradually waned to its final and entire
annihilation.
