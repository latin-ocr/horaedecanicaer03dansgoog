But then for y' archipresbyter tutelis (wu' us call’d y‘ bean tutall ¹) he was
appointed to ease ye burden of episcopacy in minorib⁸ titulis (sayes γ’ law²) in y·

w¹¹¹ γ’ oversight of y‘ rurall presbyters, and likewise γ’ people cofflitted to their
charge, and was by the antients esteem'd an office soe necessarie in the church‚ that
it was not to be intermitted, though a bishop highly qualifyed for goverm¹ were plac't

The care indeed of γ’ antient church was exceeding great for y⁰ preservation of

(¹) ‘⁸ {Rural litans are the same with sublimabunt( nitunt or rurales. and their names are
often confounded, but more frequently occurreth the name of artljtpttsbnttt, aud ia more used
among the canonista than that of betanus? Somner's Aneiq. os Cantor-bury, Part 1. p. 175.

(²) The law referred to is the last chapter, vis. the fourth, of the Deereeal before mentioned,

D. Gregor. IX. L. 1. Tit. xxrv. de Officio attbtpttshntttt. ly. ¹⁴ Ut sinqulae plebes archipresbyte-
rum habeant.'’ See Dr. Field os the Charch, p. 507.

(³) This reference of Dr. P. to the archbishop of Mentz is probably intended te point out the
latter part of L. 1. c. 5. de Iussit. clericor. as far as it is applicable to the tbnttpismpi (of whom
the archbishop is speaking) and rutel litans in common. It has been already quoted.

(⁴) The fifty-seventh canon of the council of Laodicea (AD. cccmv.) orders the institution of
ΠΕΡΙΟΔΕΥΤΑΙ, instead os ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΙ. The words of the canon have been cited. But
these spiritual physicians were not then established for the first time. Indeed, before the date
specified in Dr. P.’s ms. they are noticed in an epistle of Peter, archbishop of Alexandria,

(aiv-citer ΑΙ). ccc,), under the title of ¹‘ Presbyteri, quibus permissum erat egentes visitare.”
Routh, Reliq. Sacr. Vol. 111. p. 348. 0ae νει. Vers. Late-And again, in an epistle of the Egyptian

bishops‚ written, it may be, by Phileas, bishop of Thmuis, ιο Meletius, (about the same time.)

Itis somewhat strange, that of the ΠΕΡΙΟΔΕΥΤΗΣ, whose station and grade seem ιο have been
between the villan bishop and presbyter, no notice whatever should occur in the long and varied
catalogue of eodinus. He is briefly mentioned in the ΒΥΧΟΛΟΙἾΟΝ of Goar, p. 278.

Upon the etymology of the term ΠΕΡΙΟΔΕΥΤΗΣ, Salmasius and Suicer are at issue with
Dr. Priaulx, his canonists and scholiasts, with Meursius and Goar. The words of the cited
canonists of the text appear favourable to the interpretation of the perinundat being itinerant
preachers—HEPIOAEYTAI 33 λίμνη-αι, says Zonaras, ad Can. Lyn. Laodicen. διὰ τὲ «nectendas,
