THE diocese of Bangor contains the whole of Carnarvonshire (excepting three
parishes); the better half of Merionethshirc, one besum in Denbighshire, 31111 another
in Montgomeryshioe¹. It is divided, according to Ecton‚ into three archdeaconries—
Bangor, Merioneth, and Anglesea. Under Bangor are placed the beantits of Arvon

alias Uchor and Ister, Arllechwedd alias Uchaph, Isaph Nanconway and Cruthwyn,
and Lynn. Under Merioneth, those of Evionydd, Ardudwy and Estimanner‚ Arnsey‚
and Dyffrynclwyd and Kemerch. Under Anglesea‚ those of Llivon and Talyboliom

Meney and Maltraith, Dyndd and Turkely‚ and Twrelyn.
Within this part of the principality‚ Archdeacon Wilkins’s CC. M. B. et H. afford

no vestiges of beans 111131. Νοι· do any appear in other published records. The

time immemorial in the diocese, and still obtains,—the beans being appointed 11111131·

and present bishops of Bangor‚ 1 am indebted to Bishop Bethell.

Forasmuch as our said diocese 1133 heretofore, of old, divided into tutal utenti&

ancient constitution: Unto you, therefore, (in whose industry, ability‚ and fitness in
that behalf, 113 confide in the Lord) 113 110 grant and commit free power and autho-
rity, by these presents, from time to time. as often as you shall think fit, 10 visit the
several churches and personage and vicarial-houses within that part of the 111131
