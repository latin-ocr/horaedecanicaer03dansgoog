Fuller’s significant language, “ might have saved the
felling of episcopacy.”

The object of the “ Tractate” was shortly this—to
shew how the church might synodically be governed,
archbishops and biihops being still retained. The plan
itself is given, in full, below ¹.

 

 

 

(¹) “ 1. In every parish, the rector, or incumbent pastor, together with
the churchwardens and fidesmen, may every week take notice of such ae
live scandaloussy in that congregation, who are to receive such several
admonitione and reproofs as the quality of their offence shall deserve :
and is by this means they cannot be reclaimed, they may be presented
to the next monthly synod; and in the mean time debarred by the pastor
from acceffe unto the Lord’s table.’'

“ 11. Whereas, by a statute in the twenty-suth year os King Henry the

number of them might very well be conformed unto the number of the
several tural mantia, into which every diocese is subdivided; which
being done, the suffragan supplying the place os those wh0, in the an·
cient church, were called ebortptsstopt, might every month affemble a
§anob of all the rectore or incumbent pastore within the precinct, and,
according to the major part of their voices, conclude all matters that
shall be brought into debate before them.'’

“ To this synod the rector and churchwardens might present such
impenitent persone, as by admonitione and suspension from the sacra-
ment would not be reformed; who, if they should still remain contuma-
cious and incorrigible, the sentence of excommunication might be de-
creed against them by, the Quot), and accordingly be executed in the
pariss1 where they lived. Hithert0‚ also, all things that concerned the
parochial ministers might be referred, whether they did touch their doc-
trine or their conversation; as also, the censure of all new opinione,
heretice, and schismS, which did arife within that circuit; with ‘liberty of
appeal, if need so require, unto the diocesan synod.”

Propositions 111. and 1v. relate to diocesan and provincial synods;
