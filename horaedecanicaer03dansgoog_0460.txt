WILLIAM, by Divine permission Bishop of Llandaff, To our well-beloved and
reverend brother, William Bruce Knight, clerk, A.M., chancellor of our Cathedral
Church of Llandaff, in the beant& os Groneath alias Cowbridge, and our diocese of
Llandaff, greeting—

WhereaS, we, being very desirous fully to understand and constantly to be in-
formed of the state of our diocese, have, upon mature consideration, thought fit to
revive the ancient authority and use of tuta! beans, as one of the properest and most
conducive means in order to obtain this end, that by persons of the best ability
and integrity in every neighbourhood, we may be at all times fully informed of the
state and condition in which all things are in all the parts of our said diocese—
We, therefore, having a good account and opinion of the piety and learning, and con-
fiding in the dilig-enee and prudence of you, the said William Bruce Knight, do, by
these presents, constitute and appoint you to be a ruta! beau, in the beantp of Groneath
alias Cowbridge aforesaid3 requiring your fidelity, care, and diligence in observing,
inquiring into, and, from time to time, making a report to us of all things and persons
within all the parishes of the part of the said beant& to you assigned, concerning
which it may be proper for us, or useful to our diocese, that we should have informa-
tion. And at this time we particularly desire and require of you, that, in order to
your own knowing, and being able to inform us of the true state and condition of the
said baurg, you will, as soon as with conveniency you may, visit parochially and
examine every church and chapel, and house of the minister, within the same. And,
after such examination had, we desire, moreover, that you will leave, in writing
under your hand, an order at each place, specifying the things which you shall judge
wanting to be repaired, amended, or done there; and that you will at the end of the
said order, require, that every such paper be, by such a limited time as you shall
think proper, returned to you, with a certificate at the bottom of it, signed by the
minister and church- or chapel-wardens, that all things are repaired and done accord-
ing to what is therein directed. And when the said paper and order, with the said
certificate annexed, shall be so returned to you, we desire the same may be forthwith
transmitted to us, together with such observations thereon as you may judge to be
necessary for our information and further proceeding in the business- In doing of
which faithfully, you, the said tutal bean, will very much assist ας, your bishop‚ in
the discharge of the great duty incumbent upon us. In witness whereof, we have
caused our seal, which we use in this behalf, to be to these presents affixed. Dated
under our hand and episcopal seal, this third day of J uly, in the year of our Lord
One thousand eight hundred and nineteen, and in the first year of our consecration.
