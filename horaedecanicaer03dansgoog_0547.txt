SECT. VIR—Diome οἰ Bet-tp anu Euphor.

THIS diocese consists of the counties of Londonderry‚ Donegal‚ the greater part
of Tyrone‚ and a small part of Antrim. There is no account of the tuta! Βεωιτίεβ of
the diocese of Derry in Ware; but a Visitation-book‚ in the possession of Dr. Todd,
states them to be Derry, Mohey‚ Bynagh, and Rathlowry (ΑΒ. mcxxn.) Ware
distinctly states that Raphoe is not divided into brenti& (Vol. 1. p. 270, Worlcs by
Harris); and there is no trace of such a division, in the Visitation-book (ΑΒ. uncxxn.)
above referred to, annexed to that of Derry. Indeed, the jurisdiction of the diocese
seems to have been administered by officials under the bishop at that time.

In the see of Derry beans ruta! existed, AJ). mccccxxx„ the appointrnent to the
office being in the bishop os the diocese; and, during vacancy, in the archbishop, who
exercised the right of election, at that time, in the instance of Donat-O-Kernlan. See
Ware, as above, p. 290. and ἰὴ. Β. Β. Part 111. Sect. 1.
