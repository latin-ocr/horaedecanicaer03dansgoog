see ;—of which¹ the last but one, as reported by Collier (Eccl. Hist. B. v. p. 440),
notices beans rutel as tleen existing in the diocese. Their appointment and displace-
ment is ordered to be ‘⁸ by common consent of the bishop and archdeacons '’—in
compliance, 1 suppose, with the Lateran rescript then lately received in England.
They are also mentioned in several other canons of the earne code, published by
Wilkins; viz. in those “De reditu ad reIIJionem”—“De receptione secundi bene·
ficii”—“ Quod omnes clerici beneficiati habeant praedictas constitutiones.”—(CC. MR.
et H. Vol 1. pp. 600--1.)

Again—in Bishop Giles Bridport’s Constitutione (A.D.uc‹:1.v1.), cited in our
earlier pages, it is enjoined, in a canon expressly bearing on the institution of Beauss
tutal, that, when fit persons have been elected by the archdeacons to the office, they
are to be presented to the bishop and his succoesom ‘⁴ ad sacramentum corporale
praestandum? It is also specially ordered in the same code, that neither arch-
deacons nor rutel beans be guilty of exactione and impositions upon the clergy—
(CC. M. Β. elH. Vol. 1. p. 715- -.16) From this date we lose sight of beans rutel in
the diocese altogether for more than two centuries and a half.

Between the days of Bishop AEgidius (who died Α. D. mecum), and the date at
which the V αῖον Ecclesiasticus of Henry VIII. was compiled, viz. Α. D. unxxxv.
(when either Cardinal Campegio or Bishop Shaxton praeided over the see of Sarum),
no evidence can be adduced of their existence. At the latter date, however, they
re-appear in one of the archdeaconrieS, vie. that of Dorset, where the names of the
rutel beans then m each beant& are mentioned3 and it is said, the archdeacon paid
