In the same light, might they not be made yet further
productive of good, as the standing machinery of all ¹
eccleflastical charities-—for making known their neces-

tits 3-each associated minister gathering contributions ι
within the precincts of his own cure; and paying the 3
amount collected, at the quarterly synod, to the rutel ,Ι
Bran, as the district collector, and the latter again to ¹

the baurg of Chalke, 1 may record, as an eal-nest of the efficiency of 3
such an administration, that the collectione of the S. P. G. F. P. have 1
been increased tenfold fince the tuti-capitular organization has been ⁴
brought into activity‚ and ite agency made to bear on the church’s
miflionnry gutherings.
