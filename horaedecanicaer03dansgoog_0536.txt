THE diocese of Meath consists of the enunties of Meath, Westmeath, and King’s
County; with small parts of Longford‚ Cavan, and Kildare. It is divided, according
to ware, into twelve tuta! htantiem viz. Duleek‚ Ratoath, Scrine, Trim, Kells, Slane,
Clonard, Mullingar, Ballymore-Loughseudy, Ardnurcher, Foure, and Ballyloughgort,
alias ClonmacnoiS.¹ All which hemum& were, with others, of the grade os thottpiss-
topates, or tuta! βίω, till the visit of Cardinal Paparo in the twelfth century, when
attbptesbmoers-tutal took the place of tutal hisbops. See 32. Ε. Β. Part 11. Sect. 1.

Ι will first lay before my readers the twelve Constitutions os Simon de Rochfort, bishop
of Meath (AD. Mecium), the earliest Irish council bearing on attbipttssbgtetal
government, now extant. The distribution of dioceses into maurim only took place
in the preceding century. See Tractatas de visitationibus episcopalibus per R. P.

bishopricke of Meath. There hath been in tymes past belonging to that bishopricke a lituum,
yet contayning an archdeaconry and twelve prebendaries—all long since wasted and extinct—
which all were mayntayned by the offerings and funerans. The churches of Clonmacknoshe
being the auncyent buriall-places of the kings of Ireland, and of the best of the nobility of the
same—there is in one church-yard tenne churcheS‚ whereoff two are in reasonablie good re·
payre.” Usher’s Visitaeion Book, fug. penes, Rev. Dr. Todd.—A.D. nncxxn.

In the Calendarium Rot. Patent. διο. (Dublin uncccxxvm.) the Rev. W. Reeves informs me
that a noll, dated 4 chr. IV. records six *utentia in this diocese ; and a second, dated l Henr. VI„
records ten. Baronies occur in the same Roll, bearing the same names as the manticas, in eight
several instances; and Mr. Reeves is of opinion that the seculsr was modelled upon the ecclesi-
astical division, the latter having the precedence.
