In the year mccxxx. the office still existed; and Bishop Keppel is reported to
have interested himself in making it more efficient, about the year nnccnxx. At the
present time, a Commiest‘on annually issues (the archdeacon of Barnstaple informs
me) from the chancellor, in the bishop's name, to the archdeacons of the different
archdeaconries, empowering them to swear such persons as the clergy of the several
beanda elect to sulfil the duties of beatu rutel. The election in the archdeaconry of
Barnstaple was heretofore annual, subsequently biennial, and is now considered to
be, with permission, triennial,

‘⁴ Up to the year mcccxxxt '' (the archdeacon of Totness states) “ the ruta! benni
of that archdeaconry were chosen annually, under a mandate issued from the dio-
cesan court of Exeter. The elections took place at the yearly visitation of the arch·
deacon, at six different places in his district, where such meetings have been
regularly held. As, for obvious reasons, the short duration of the office was found
to intersere materially with its efficiency, the bishop's sanction was given to a
triennial instead of an annual election3 and, since the year above mentioned, such
alteration has been acted on.” ⁷.

In the archdeaconry of Exeter the office still continues to be an annual one, as
far as respects the election. But many years ago the archdeacon induced the clergy-
man appointed to it to hold it for a second year; and, for the last few years, to con-
tinue it for a third year, receiving the appointment annually at the visitation.
A noviter inductus, by custom, takes the office! This is assuredly a very objectionable
arrangement. Far better would it be that the office should be permanent, and that
the most competent person should be elected to discharge it.

The attached documents, kindly supplied by the Rev. John Wallis of Bodmin‚ will
speak for themselves as to the usages of the archdeaconry of Cornwall in detail.
The same mandate and oath are used in the other archdeaconries—-mntatis mutandis.

Bishop Atterbury’s summary of the history and duties of beans rutel in ⁸qeneral,
and of the diocese of Exeter in particular, Ῑ have caused to be reprinted entire;
though the most important parts of it have been enrolled in the body of the preceding
work. It is, without doubt, the best epitome of the office anywhere extant—with
the single exception of Bishop Kennett's in his Paroclzial Antiquities.

REVBRRN D wulstanum,

MY proeent desig-n is, to speak to you concerning that very ancient and useful
office of bran τυπεὶς an office which hath formerly contributed much to support and
enliven the discipline of the church; and might be of equal use still, if the powers
heretofore annexed to it were duly revived and executed. However, even upon the
foot it now stands, especially in this diocese, it is of great service, when discharged
