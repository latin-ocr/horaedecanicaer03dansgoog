SEc'r. xva—mmm of alanusff.

THE diocese of Llandaff comprises the counties of Glamorgan and Monmouth,
which are included in one archdeaconry3 viz. Llandaff—comprehending the Uzentini
of Groneath or Cowbridge, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Netherwent or Chepstow,
Newport, and Uske. Beatus tuta! are of modern introduction into the diocese.
They are not recorded in the Ecclesiastical Valors, nor in the CC. M. Β. et H. of
wilkins».

Bishop Marsh sayS‚ that he ‘⁴ revived the ancient order of tutal Deam? here during
his incumbency (A. D. uncccxv1.—Mncccx1x.)—which looks as if it had existed at
an earlier date¹. It was continued by Bishop Van Mildert (ΑΒ. mccxxx.—
uncocxxw.); and by Bishop Sumner (ΑΙ). uncccxxv1.—uncccxxvn.); and is still
supported by Bishop Copleston (AD. unoecxxxv.)

The remarks of Bishop Marsh on the turi-betam! system, as it worked under his
watchful eye in another diocese, will be found by referring to the documenta of the
see of Peterborough. The Questions issued by him for the use of his beans in the
diocese of Llandaff are annexed (1.). Ι am not aware that he made use of any par-
ticular form of commission. Such, however, was employed by his successor, Bishop
Van Mildert, and has been kindly furnished to me (2.), with the instrumenta now in

use, by the Very Reverend W. Bruce Knight, Dean of Llandaff cathedral.
“ In common with your late diocoean,” says Bishop Van Mildert in his Primary

(¹) In the clergy-charity regulations, established by Bishop Barrington‚ AD. xnccnxxxv„
Bau Knight informs me reference is made to rutel umus as the parties who are to receive
subscriptions; but there is no other trace of their existence at that time.
