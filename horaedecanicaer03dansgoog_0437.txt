The chartet- of erection of the see of Gloucester-¹ bears date A.D. mount and we
have evidence of the existence of benni} tuta! in the diocese fifteen years after,
viz. A.D. mmm.

The “ Injunctions yeven in tlte visitacion of the monle reverende father in God, the
Iov-de Cardinal Poole’s yrace, leyate de Latere, by his subdeleyate JameS, by the
permis-sion of G'od buskope of Gloucestre, utrouqheoute leis diocesis of Gloucestre‚’'
notice them as, at that time, in the employment of “ the ordinarie.” (See
CC. M. Β. εἰ Η. vol. iv. p. 146.)

After the lapse of more than a century and a half, it is reported, by Archbishop
Secker, of Bishop Benson, that, on the latter’s appointment to the see of Gloucester
(A.D.mnccxxx1v.)‚ ‘⁸ he found the very useful institution of tuta! Deam! not quite
extinct,” and that “ he completely revived it.’' See Secker's Char-968, Fistta Charye,
unccun. p. 1863 and Porteus's sze queclcer, Worlcs, Vol. v1. p. 42.)

Whether the office had ever been suspended, after its first establisbment in the
very infancy of the see, does not appear. Eqnally uncertain is its condition, from the
days of Bishop Benson (A.D.unccxxx1v.—mnccmr.) to those of Bishop Huntingford
(AD. uncoc11.—mooccxv). During the latter's incumbency, tbe only evidence 1
have to adduce of the existence of heaua' tuta! in the diocese (and meagre as it is, it
is just worthy of notation), is the dedication of the bishop's admirable Charye to tlze
δίει-93] on tlte petition os uze Enylislz Roman Cadmum,- which is addressed “ to the
archdeacon‚ beans tutal, and clergy of the diocese,'’ (AD. Mncocx).

Bishop Benson was a most active and energetic renovator of the useful powers of
Utens tutat. ln his letter of commission, issued'shortly before his primary visitation‚
he expresses his determination “ to continue the ancient authority and use of rutal
bians? The same determination is expressed by Bishop Monk—-“ to continue the
office where it now is, and to revive it where it is not.'’ The documents (1 and 2)
employed in the old diocese of Gloucester by Bishops Benson and Monk‚ and kindly
supplied to me by the Rev. H. H. NorriS, rector of South Hackney, are annexed.
Bishop Monk has very obligingly added to these instrumente (N ⁰. 3), which has been

used by him for six years past.
