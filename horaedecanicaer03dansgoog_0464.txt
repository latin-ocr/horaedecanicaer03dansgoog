About A.D. Mnnxxx„ Bishop Freak suggested the revival of these officere, in a
paper sent by his chancellor to a diocesan synod; “recommending tuta! beans or
suptttnttuheutsss' says the annalist of the Reformation, “to inspect and take care of
the diocese under the bishop3 and particularly for providing monthly prophesyinys,
(if it might be permitted), or sermons, in the several mantin, to be preached. At
which the respective tuta! beauss to be present, and, to prevent schisms and factions,
to be moderators. And thereat likewise various businesses‚ respecting the abuses of
bishops’ courts and their offices, and inspection into the behaviour of the clergy and
laity in each parisb, to be transacted. It bore this title, A form of qovernment
exhibita! by tlte Chaucellor os Norwich.'’ See the document following (Νο. 2); and
Strype's Armate of the Reformation, Vol. 11. Part 11. anno maxx. pp. 382. 695.

It is probable that this proposal of Freak's was acted upon; or, at least, that
beans tuta! were re-instated upon some new footing, their elder constitution having
been abrogated forty years before. For we are told by Dr. Prideaux, (Directc'ons to
Churchwardem, 9th edit. p. 17 9), ‘⁴ they continued here, and made their annual
presentations at diocesan synods till the Rebellion A.D. hincm? “ On the Restora-
tion of King Charles ΙΙ. the keeping of these synods, as also the appointing of tuta!
beans, were, by Bishop Reynolds (a presbyterian in principle, though then promoted
to this see) both let down, to the great damage of the church in this diocese, and have
never since been revived in it; and perchance now, aster so long a disusage, it would
be in vain to attempt it, especially in our present circumstances.’'

“Bishop Lloyd went so far in his primary visitation, as to name tuta! beans in
every beant& of the diocese3 but found such opposition to it, both from the per-
verseness of some persons who thought themselves concerned in interest to oppose it,
as well as from the ill-temper of the times, which we were then fallen into, that he
was forced to let all drop, and proceed no further3 and so it must rest till a more
favourable juncture shall arise for the setting of all right again that hath gone wrong
among us. For it is to be hoped, that there is in the lap of Providence an appointed
time yet to come, when, through God's mercy towards ue, discipline may be
thoroughly revived in this church, and Christian religion again restored to its pri·
mitive purity in it; although, through the ill-disposition of the present times, it may
justly be seared‚ that without a long purifying in the fumace of affliction there will
be no attaining theret0. Ι pray God grant the end, whatsoever may be the means,

whereby we are to be brought to it.”
