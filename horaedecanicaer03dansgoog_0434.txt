and inquire what has been done thereon, within the year past. Itis obvious from
this regulation‚ that the book, with the presentments filled up, and signed by the
Imm tutal, should be returned to the registry-office some short time before the arch-
deacon’s visitation begine, that it may be ready sor the archdeacon's inspection, and
a copy thereos made for the succeeding bean τυπείς and also a copy, so far as relatee
to each parish‚ for the new churchwardens, when they come to be sworn at the visita·
tion. To insure this, and that no accident may occur in the conveyance of the book
to the registry·office, the apparitor will have directions to call for it at the bean tutal’s
glebe·house¹. when he goes with the annual citation to summon him to the visitation,
which is usually a month before the visitation begins. It is therefore requested‚ that
the bean tuta! will be punctual in getting this book ready for the apparitor; as it is
evident that any disappointment will be attended with great inconvenience to all
parties. In order to give as much time as possible to* the churchwardens to do the
repairs‚ and supply the defecta stated in the presentments„ it would be desirable that
the bean tuta! should defer his visiting till within a fortnight or three weeks of the
time of the apparitor-’s calling for the book3 that is, about six weeks before Whitsun-
week, when the visitatione usually begin.

instructions for executing the office of bean rutel.
