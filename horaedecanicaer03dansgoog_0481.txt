Smer. XXL—Rlottst of Rhion.

THE diocese of Ripon contains about two-fisths of the county of York3 and is
divided into two archdeaconries 2—1. Craven3 containing the henum of Craven, parts
of the manti& of the Ainsty and Pontefract, and a small part of the beant& of Don-
easter. 11. Richmond, in Ripon diocese; containing the mantin! of Boroughbridge,
Richmond, Catterick, Kirkby Lonsdale (in part, the rest being in Chester diocese),
and Ripon. This information has been very kindly supplied by Bishop Longley.
In reply to my inquiry as to the tuti-betuna! administration of this nearly-created
diocese, the Bishop of Ripon further informs me, that “he has not as yet appointed
any tuta! Beana? As the commissary’s jurisdiction at present over-rides the bishop’s
in reference to this department of discipline within the archdeaconry of Richmond,
the Ecclesiastical Courts’ Bill will probably hereafter place his lordship in a more
favour-able position for the establishment of tuta! beans upon one uniform system
throughout his diocese. In the meanwhile, the commissary of Richmond, under the
authority of his patent, has appointed bite-beans within the jurisdiction of that arch-
deaeonry. They were established, A.D. mcccxxx 1x., in eleven betuna! bissttsttss as
hepatia to the commissary; and exercise their functione under him as ordinary tuta!
beans would do, the commissary standing towards them in the relation of archdeacon.

 

sFicT. XXII.—160ttst of Rotbaestoer.

THE diocese of Rochester is considered the most ancient in England, excepting
Canterbury. It contains a small part of the county of Kent, the parish of Iselham
in Cambridgeshire, and Freckenham in the county of Suffolk.¹ In this compara?
tively small diocese, no traces appear of heau& tuta! having ever existed: nor is
it the intention of Bishop Murray to institute them. With the aid of his archdeacon,
who annually holds a parochial visitation‚ the bishop informs me, he is made suffi-
ciently well acquainted with the condition of his diocese, and has no necessity for
the introduction of other helpmates in the administration of its discipline. It

(¹) By the Churoh Commission (Aa). nncccxxxv.), it is proposed that the diocese of Roehester
shall consist of the city and usuum of Rochester5 of the county of Essex (excepting those parishes
which will remain in the diocese of London); and of the whole county of Hertford. See London
