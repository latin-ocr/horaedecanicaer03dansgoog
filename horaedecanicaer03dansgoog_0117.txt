Pegge's Life qs

Bissmp Groffeteste, “ first of all appointed a principal Groffetene.
mllector, called also eoeecutor, who administered an oath {Romefiss‘qmffl'
to the tutal Mans and the rectors or vicars of the most 3²²¹”ss3‘ffl burton·
consequence in the [baptets of every fleantp in the re· jp' ’
spective dioceses, to make a true return. These, there· ζ

fore, were the persons that in fact made the Ualutz, and
had a power os tendering an oath to the parties they ‚
were to examine and inquire os, and, in case of contu· l
macy, os interdicting or excommunicating them. The Ι
return of the heau and his assotians was to be made in ξ
writing‚ under their seaIS, at a certain time and place. ζ
The religious houses were to be rated along with the l
secular benefices 3 and though, in the present case, the ¹
favourite orders os the CistercianS, the HospitallerS, and
Templarffi were to be exempted, (the two latter, I pre-
sume‚ on account os the personal service to be performed ,
by them in the Holy Land, this subfidy being intended
sor the Crusade), yet the Ualot was to include them, to Ι
be ready, we will suppose, on future occasionS. If the z
religious house was fituated in the Beuum, then the ι
effects thereos were to be taxed by the religious them· f
selves, upon oath 32. namely, such os their effects as did ·
not confist in appropriate'churches, or separate tithes, f
for these would sall under the cognisance of the tutal ἶ
bran and his partuum but, if the foundation was in
another henum, then these α55ε55οῐ5 were to rate what z
effects lay in their Πεῖιιιτρ. Is a benefice was sarmed, it ’ν

might be entered sor payment, according to the rent.

The tutans, lastly, were to proceed, under pain os ex· Summum,
