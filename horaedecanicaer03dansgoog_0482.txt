ΤΗΕ diocese of Saint Asaph¹ comprises parts of Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire,
Carnarvonshire‚ Merionethshire, Flint, and Salop, constituting one archdeaconry, viz.
Saint Asaph: which is sub-divided into the following tuta! Βωιιτίεβς viz. Tegengle,
Moulde, Poole and Carenion, Kydewen, Keviliock, Mowthwy, Penllyn and Idernion,
Rhos, Bromfield and Yale, and Marchia..

In the Appendioe to Mr. Wharton’s Historia de Epi-scopis Assavensibus ἅο.
(pp. 378—381) there is an epistle of Archbishop Peckham, addressed to Anian bishop
of Saint Asaph, on the discipline of his church and diocese; from which it appears
that Όεαῐιβ tutal were employed, as supervisors of the clergy of Saint Amph, in the
year mccnxxxiv.—correcting them for uncanonical attire, and errors of life and
conversation3 and receiving procurations of rectors and vicars at the time of visita·
tion. From that date there is no notice of their existence. Wilkins affords no later
tidings of them, in any church-document of this see. They were not in being when
the Valor Ecclesiasticus Henrici VIII. was compiled.

The office, however, obtained in the early part of the present century, as the
following extract from the St. Asaph Subscrc'ption Book manifesta It is the only
case of a formal subscription to the thirty-nine articles δῖα, by a tuta! blau, as an act
of institution which Ι have met with. There are no further records of the office,
Mr. Wyatt informs me, to be found among the papers under his custody in the see
of St. Asaph.

Bishop Horsley availed himself of the agency of tuta! beans during the time he
presided over the diocese. In his Primary Charye Μοῦσαι, he writes: ‘⁸ I think it
my duty to apply myself immediately to the reformation os these flagrant abuses”
[clergymen officiating as curates without episcopal licence]; “ and for that purpose
1 require every person officiating as a curate in any part of my diocese, without
further notice or requisition than that which 1 now give, on or before the lst day of
the month of October next, to go before the tutal bean of the district in which the
parish or chapelry in which he serves is situated, and to exhibit to the said tuta! bean
his letters of orders, a testimonium, signed by three clergymen‚ of his godly life and
conversation, and his nomination to the cure by the incumbent of the living. These
particulars I expect the rutel bean to report to me3 and if 1 see reason to be satisfied

(¹) Itis proposed by the Chat-ch Commission (AD. unccoxxxv.--v1.) that the sees of St„ Asaph
and Bangor be united: and the diocese consist of the whole of the two existing dioceses (except
that part of the diocese of St. Asaph which is in the county of Salop), and of those parts of the
county of Montgomery which ere now in the dioceses of St. David's end Hereford.
