The Letter of George Ι. to the Convocatc'on, about bustness ¹

humbly conceived, that no person, who is bound to executa the com· ῌᾞΙ

as well as to the biffiop, it is humbly hoped that the infer-enee which
the Lower Houfi drew from thence (videlicet, that therefore the arch·
deacon ought in reason to be concerned together with the bissmp in ⁹
placing and displacing of them) will still be thought just and equitable.

4th. That whereas your Lordships are of opinion, that the decretal
epistle of Innocent the Third is of less weight for being written in a
time when the popes made it their business to lefl'en the authority of the
bissiopa for the increase of their own; we beg leave to observe, that
that declaration of the authority of the archdeacon over tuta! btanss
cannot (aa we conceive) be reckoned among the methods invented and

as that epistle doth not make tutal beans ministerial to the archdeacon, τ
but supposes them to be so by the nature of their office3 nor ia that
decifion grounded upon an arbitrary declaration of the pope, but upon
an established maxim of law, which holds generally in cases of the like ¹
nature: Ciam ab omnibus, quod omnes tangit, approbari debeat, et ciam
commune eorum boetauuss officium exerceat, communiter est eliyendm, vel
etiam amovendus?

founded upon it, were not alleged by the Lower Houfi in bar to the
right and authority of Convocation to alter the law ιιι this particular, but
only to ssiew, that the power they desire in behalf of archdeacons is Ι
agreeable both to law and reason of former times: and they do stillj,
humbly hope, that, inasmuch as the reason os the law continues, your
[οι-«Ψήρα will be pleased to agree, that the law itsels (as ιιι placing, so
in displacing, tutal benna) may be enforced by the constitution intended
to be drawn upon this head.

for the choice of tutal brana (the authority os which directions we do not Ι
