To this statement I entirely subscribe; while I add,
that they have never been proscribed —never put down
by the legissature. They have fimply fallen into disuse
and decay. They have become antiquated and obsolete,.
to the great loss and detriment of the Church, merely,⁴
because their subfidiary importance to Church polity!
has not been duly appreciated by the clergy. They*
may, therefore, at any time be revived, with the sanc-1
tion of the Hierarchy. Nay any zealous Diocesan may}
restore them, and, with the aid of their machinery,²

 

 

work out his schemes of general or local improvement,
in the distant departments of his diocese, with as much
facility and efficacy as if those departments were under
his own personal cognizance. Whenever, and wherever‚
he needs a correspondence with the rural clergy, he
may avail himself of the instrumentality of tutal 8181181
and thaptttz, for making known his wishes and executing ξ
his mandates; and srom the same source he may derive

 

 

 

“The greatest objection against their restoration 18, 11181 ill-endowed
clergy can’t bear the burthen of capitular mtettnssss. But it may be con· Ι
fider-ed, they go but five miles 81 farthest3 and make no payments but
ρει-[8881 charges, which lie on them when-ever they are. They may
retoench other expenees, to serve God and his 81181811 11118 way. We
see justices of the peace serve their country qratis ;-why may not the
cleu-gy serve the 81181811 88 freely Ρ ’Tin confest, justices' 8118188 818 fin· Ι
greater, but so is their post also ;—why may not 1118 clergy be 88 free to ξ
serve unity and piety‚ 88 sectaries to serve schism and fection? ’Tin not ⁴
impoffible 18 11811881 some way to help the weaker clergy. Her Majesty, ς
18 1181· 8181881 1188881, 118111 given 8 glot-icus example to the 881188. If ὲ
they oen’t see it, that have the church’s patrimony in their hands, they j
may be sure 1118 god of 11118 world blinds them. Howwer, if the pre·
‹lecess'ors of the clergy have stooped to 11118 burthen heretofore‚ why
ffiould it now be thought insupportable Ρ ” 2
