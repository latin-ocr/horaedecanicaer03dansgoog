some laws, provided and established in that behalf.

And for that the bishop is counted in the law the pastor of the whole diocess, in
consideration thereos that antient father cryeth out3 V ω mihi.- non essem de numero
dam-natorum, si non essem de numero proelalorum. And therefore bound to have
a special knowledge of every particular man of his dioeaes, as near as possibly he
may. And he must devise and practise the most certain and ready way, to set before
his eyes, as it were in one view, the true estate and platform, and every several part
thereos.

To which end, since it appears by antient records in the bishop's office, for these
three hundred years, that certain choise, picked men were appointed and authorized
in every several branta, ealled in law uetant tutaltm and in the bisbop's canons»,
snpaettnttnututts; that is, some preachers, resident in the besum, orderly, grave,
learned, discrete, and zelous= it is necessary to renew and revive that antient, com·
mendable practice.

Whereby the commissaries and officials, to the great ease of the country, and
avoiding excessive charges, may be enjoyned to keep their circuits; and once a year,
or twice at the most3 whereto law restraineth them.

In whose visitation, what selling of the peoples sins, without any reg-ard or consi·

tions and briberies are used by abuse of registers; all the whole country, with
detestation, seeth. And thereupon most men, by the abuse, do utterly contemne all
ecclesiastieal government.

if not, to a sermon every mouth, may eall the ministry and questmen. And then
and there inquire of all disorders. And to compound and reform the lesser, and
certify to the bishop the greater.

of every minister in the bznata, but also of every man of account; which may either
be profitable or dangerous to the state, in their several parishes. And exhibit their
names, according to every several bznata, in a fair long parchment scrole, to the
bishop, or his chancellor3 to remain with them, or either of them: giving advertise-

the bishop shall be able to cut off any mischief, as it first springeth forth3 and be a
most notable instrument of advertising and preserving the estate. Besides, by the

and enormous sins, may be restrained and punished. Which now are jesting matters,
of small account.
