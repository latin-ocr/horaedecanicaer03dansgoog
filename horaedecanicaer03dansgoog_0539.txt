δεον. 111. IV.] metesa of §uesta—&iluna 523

In reply to my inquiries respecting the office as at present discharged in the diocese
of Meath, Bishop Stopford very briefly states that “ the rutel beans have no commissions
here, not having legal jurisdiction.'' (oct. 9, uncccxun.) Robertson's Clerical
Reqister for the year mcccxuv. states their number to be eleven.

 

SECT. IV.-Biottse of atinate.

THIS diocese consists of the greater portion of the county of Kildare, and King’s
and Queen’s Counties. Whether it was of old divided into ruta! bestiti& or not, Ι
am uninformed. Ware does not record any such divisions. In nmcnxxxn. the
Uenutius are styled Kildare, Naas, Clane, Killighy: at present they are Carbury‚
NaaS, Kildare, Lea, Geashi113 and are presided over by four tutal beans, whose
names are given in Robertson’s Clerical Reyister for the year Mocccxuv.

My readers are indebted to the Rev. C. Crosthwaite of Monasterevan, and the
Rev. J. Browne, registrar of the diocese, for all the information Ι am enabled to lay
before them respecting the hetanal office of the diocese of Kildare. No ancient recor-ds
exist in the registry, the whole having been carried away in the year mncxm. by the
Roman-Catholic bishop3 and what became of them is not known. The fact of their
having been so carried off was attested at the Restoration, in a document still existing.

The diocese seems ιο have been early divided into nuntiem but the exact date
thereos is not known. It had clearly been so distributed when a parochia] assessment
was made for the payment of the diocesan schoolmaster, A.D. Mocnxxx11.; though
there is no express notice of beans at that date. The office was restored, AD. Μοῦσαι,
by Bishop J ones, whose commission is annexed. It again fell into disuse till
A.D. Mocccxrx„ when the present bishop, who succeeded AD. uncccw„ restored it
once more, and re-divided the diocese. The Queries now issued triennially by the
archbishop, preparatory to his grace’s visitation of the diocese, are subjoined.

GEORGE LEWIS, by Divine Providence Lord Bishop of Kildare, To our
beloved in Christ, the Rev. clerk, M.A., greeting—

Uenutius or districts, and tuta! beans were appointed therein, we have thought fit, the
