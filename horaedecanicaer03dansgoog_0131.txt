volventem jurisdiction might be advantageoussy restored
—making allowance only sor the difference of the times,

But I would not go beyond this point. Endless jarrings

would alise, and discipline would be rather marred than
promoted, by re·convening such capitula under the cha-

objection.

The ecclesiastical councils of Great Britain, Ireland,
France, and Germany, afford ample testimony to the
important bearing of Iutal cletital zuttztits (acting upon
one uniform system, in close and responsible connexion
with the episcopal see) on the interests of the church
and its memberS‚ both lay and clerical. Nor are they
our only witnefl'es. With equal confidence we might
refer, sor a practical acknowledgment of their utility, ,
to the councils of Charles Borromeo, “ the sainted disci- ξ

vouchers extend, collectively, over a period approaching
to a thousand years. But it is unneceffary to have
recourse to foreign authorities,

Our national church—the united church of England ,
and Ireland—needs no other voucher than her own
councils, and her own experience. She need not search,
amidst continental archiveS, either for examples of the

institution and economy of tutal thamuz, or for proofs ἦ ,
