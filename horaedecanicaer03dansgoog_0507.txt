Sscr. XXV.] Biotaeat of Salisbutg. 491

cursam, or manant, whose office Blastares, Zonaras, and Balsamon, agree y‘ it waS,
to goe from village to village in γ’ country, and καταρτίζειν τοὺς πιστοὺς, by correp·
tion, admonition and encourag1n² (as need was) to help foi-ward y‘⁵ salvation of be·-
lievers‚ and to labour also in γ’ conversion of infidells: this office instituted ab‘ γ’
yeer of Χι cccxm. is γ’ wer. (as before 1 hinted) may be thought to have weaken’d γ’

credit of γ’ εῇοτψίβεοῃίς and seems to be γ’ same w‘¹² the EzAPx01¹ of ye bishops
in after ages, as some doe rightly conjecture.

put upon the term by Dr. Cave, (P. C. Part 1. c. vm. p. 224), and Dr. Routh, (Reliq. Sacr. Vol. 111.
p. 477). But it is the opinion of Salmasius (de Primam) snd Suicer (Thes. Ecol.) that the
perium were residente rather than itiner-anes, or circumens-satore. And, indeed, notwithstand-
ing Goar’s “ Caveat Salmasius ne circulatores sucos et thoriacum divendantes, pro veris corporum
curatoribus inperat? διο. (Euohol. p. 289)—there is much plausibility in these learned men’s
hypotheses. The primary signification of ΠΕΡΙΟΔΕΥΤΗΣ, say they, being medicus, cujuscunque
morbi curator (not lustrator, vinitor, as supposed by Mem-sius, Gt. p. 420) ε the term may secon-
dasily signify curatos· anima 5—whence presbyters of urban and rural parisheS, with cure of souls,
were called curati. ¹⁶ Non enim,” says Suicer, Vol. 11. col. 676, in voce—“ ΠΕΡΙΟΔΕΥΤΑῙ illi,
qui pro chorepiscopis dicti sunt, ec in eorum nomen locumque successerunt, ita vocabantur, quod
circitor-es essent. In uno quippe loco manebant iraenoaeoku, id esc curantes, ut urbium episcopi.”
Hoffman says: ‘⁶ ῆβεῐίοῧειιίε, Gmoe ΠΕΡΙΟΔΒΥἸἯΣ, hizliatnr est-officium ecclesiasticum apud
Graeoos, institutum in concilio laodicensi, pro vinis, terris, ασ castellis, in quibus episcopi non
erant. . . . . Iidem in Constaminopolitand synodo mallatura, ὰ Greyorio Thessalonic. ‘amhn-
laturas, ὰ Balsamonc aetthi dicuntur-,⁹⁹ διο. Vol. 111. p. 664, in voce. The pztlniltuta was», in grado
of office, intermediate between the tbnttpiztnpus and presbyten as is distinctly set forth by
Gennadius, patriarch of Constantinople, in his epistle published by Alexius Aristinus, in his
synopsis. See Bevereg. Synodio. Tom. 11.

(¹) Not the μητρὸς-ουτω so called, with whom we have no concern; but ἘΞΑΡΧΟῙ under the

bishops of later date. “Poste-<2 ΕΞΑΡΧΟΙ dicei quoque therminum? says Meursius in Glossar.
P· 157—“quau' σε principatu dependentes aliorum. Hinc illud scholiasta in Can. 1x. Synodi
Antiocheno, ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΙ, σι’ νῦν &sriptum ΕΞΑΡΧΟΙ, εἴη τετραάρχου sicar, εἴη μητςστολίτου.”
When alluding to the supposed identity of aetthi and pttin'fltutuc, and giving his sanction to its
probability, our author had in view, likely, Balsamon’s commentsry on the cited canon of Lao.

Many of the services of the Bastern txatth (a functionary assuredly very nearly allied to the
ΠΕΡῙΟΔΕΥἸἮΣ and precedaneous bisbnp nt ὼε tomum) were heretofore performed by archdes·
00⁰8, and bitem attbprizstz or rutel Utens, in the Western parts of Europe—a circumstance which
renders any attempt to illustrate his dnties not out of place in these notes. Indeed‚ it must be
borne in mind by the render, that out of the tbuttpiztnpal office sprung the rutel Βιῐυτέ (as is
fully shewn elsewhere from Spelman, Valesius, Stillingfleet, and other competent authorities);
and therefore if the former approximate in the same degree to the txattljital office, there will be
little difficulty in connecting the latter with the arthiprssbnttral nt ms tnunttn. But to facts 2—-
Codinus (p. 168) tells us that curtus were vicars and legates», or ambassadors, of the patriarcha!
