Tua ruta! beau is required to visit once in the year, at such time as shall be
appointed by the archdeacon, the several parishes within his mamm and to make
a return ιο the archdeacon, for the information of the archbishop, in reg-ard to the
several particulars hereinafter mentioned :—

The condition of the churches, chapels, chancels, and churchyards; and the books,
ornaments, and utensils, thereto belonging.

The preservation of the parish-registers, the making due entries therein, and the
regular transmission of the annual return, to the registry at Canterbury.

The due performance of Divine Service in the church; the administration of the
Lord's Supper3 and the average number of communicants.

The residence of the curates of non-resident incumbents3 the state of the national
or parochial schools, · and, in general, the education of the poor, in connexion with
the established church.

The state of the houseS, buildings, and glebe- -,lands attached to benefices; including
all additions to, or alterations, decayS, or dilapidations ιιι, the premises.

It will be advisable that the tuta! bean should request some beneficed clergyman,
residing ιιι the heanty, to assist him ιιι his visitation.

The ruta! beau is also required to give information to the archdeacon of the
avoidance of any benefice within his hlauta, and of the measures to be taken to
secure the performance of the parochial duties during the vacancy; and also to
report to him, as occasion may require, on all matters concerning the church or the
clergy, which the ordinary ought to know.

It does not appear that any new official instruments have been issued since my
last impression. But the most reverend prelate informs me that he has found the
tuta! beans, as a body, of great use in advising the clergy, and in communicating
with himself, either immediately, or through the medium of the archdeacon‚ on the
concerns of the diocese. (Sept. unoccxmn.) See Charye, Sept. 1840.
