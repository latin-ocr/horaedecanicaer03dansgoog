THIS diocese consists of the counties of Limerick and Kerry, with small portions
of Clare and Cork. According to Ware, Limerick is divided into five tuta! tenattem
viz. Kilmalloch, Adare, Garth, alias Ballingarry, Ardagh, and Rathkele. Ardfert has
been annexed to it since nocuum but Ι find no account of its Bautica either before
or since its union. See Harris’s Ware’s Worlcs, vol. 1. pp. 501, 518. There are at
present fourteen tuta! beans in Limerick, and the same number in Ardfert and
Aghadoe.

The late Bishop J ebb had kindly promised to supply me with all the information
he could procure respecting the ancient and modern history of Beana* tuta! here and
elsewhere in Ireland3 and if his valuable life had been spared a little longer, that
promise would, no doubt, have been fulfilled. But Dao aliter visum est! he hath
begun “the travel of eternity.” My readers will peruse with pleasure, in the
absence of all information from the present Bishop of Limerick as to the usages of
his see, the following eloquent appeal of him who is no more .·-—

“ There is another class of dignitarieS, so called,'’ says Bishop J ebb, in his Speeclz
in tlae Home of Lords on the Churclz in Ireland, “ respecting whom a word must be
said; 1 mean the tuta! beans. Of this body we have heard much. They have been
repeatedly brought forward, as contributing to swell the pomp and dignity df the
episcopal retinuez as drawing large revenues from the oppressed population; as
constituting one great division of the enormous staff of the church.

‘⁴ Now what, in reality, are these portentous tuta! beans? My Lords, they are
simply six or eight of the parochial elergy in each diocese, selected on account of
their good character, or appointed in rotation, to discharge the laborious, invidious,
and unpaid duty of visiting and reporting upon every parish in their roepective
districts· Every year, previously to the bishop’s visitation, and at as many other
times as the bishop may require, they inspect the glebes and glebe-houses, the church-
yards and churches, the vestments, the books, the communion-plate and linen, and all
things requisite for the celebration of divine service. On all these particulars
they make a special report; as also on the condition and regularity of parish
registers3 on the residence and attendance at church of the officiating clergy ς
on the number of communicants, whether monthly or at the great festivals; on the
time set apart for the catechetical-examination of young persons; and the numbers
actually catechized in the church.

“ Such, My Lords, are our Irish tuta! beans, and such the duties which they per·
form. And it appears that these idle and useless staff-officere, in addition to their
ordinary duties, undertake this charge, which implies much labour, much travelling,
sometimes no trivial expence, without any other recompense whatever than the
consciousness of being usefully employed.”-—Practical Dreoloyy, vol. 11. pp. 368, 369.
