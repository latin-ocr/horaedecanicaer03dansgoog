In the archdeaconry of Chichester it has been resolved by several tbapttrffi at the
recommendation of the archdeacon, that each meoettng should be preceded by a tom-
ιιωῐιίοιις but this has not yet been adopted in the archdeaconry of Lewes. Generally,
however, uniformity of practice may be said to prevail, under the sanction of Bishop
Otter’s tupitulat cehe, throughout the diocese3 and I am happy to add, on the best
authority, that ‘⁸ the tbaptrts are found highly useful. They have already promoted
unity of feeling and practice, kindliness, and an extensive intercourse among clergy-
men hitherto divided; and this is issuing in a restoration of the order and offices of
the church with much hearty co·operation.”

SECT. XL—Biottsse of Ἑῑῃ.

THE diocese of ΕΙ)ἰ consists of Cambridgeshire‚ Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire,
and part of Suffolk. It is divided into four archdeaconries. 1. E1y; containing the
beantitss of Barton, Bourne alias Knapwell, Cambridge, Chesterton, Ely, Shengey, and
Wisbech. 2. Bedsord; containing the tramite of Bedford, Clopham, Dunstable,
Baton, Fleet, and Shefford. 3. Huntingdon3 containing the heautirs of Huntingdon,
St. Ive's‚ Leightonstone, St. Neot’s, and Yaxley. 4. Sudbury; containing the tutantia
of Blackburne, Camps‚ Clare, Fordham, Sudbury, Thedwaster. and Thingo.

Great additions have been made to this diocese by the Ecclesiastico] Commissioners
since my first publication; but 1 may repeat, what I there said, that no published
records present any traces of Beana tutal having ever existed within the old diocese
of E1y2. Bishop Allen, however, has very wisely availed himself of betuna! gahamon
in his present more extensive jurisdiction; and informs me (Sept. nncccxnun), when
sending the annexed commission and schedula, that ‘⁶ his diocese has been very
much benefitted by the appointment.” ‘⁸ Having neither archdeacon, nor chancellor,
nor registrar, resident in my diocese,’' the bishop observes, “ I should be entirely
destitute of assistance, were it not for my tuta! braum wh0, I am happy to say, have
exerted themselves with such good feeling and discretion, that they have succeeded

(¹) It is proposed by the Charch Commi-wion (AD. uncccxxxv.--v1.) that the diocese of Bly
shall be increased by the counties of Huntingdon and Bedford, now in the diocese of Lincoln 3-
by the maurita of Lynn and Fincham, in the county of Norfolk‚ and diocese of Norwich ;-and
by the archdeaconry of Sudbury, in the county of Suffolk, and diocese of Norwich; with the
exception of the usauria of Sudbury, Stow‚ and Hartismere. which will remain in the lat-ter
diocese, and by that part of the county of Cambridge, which is now in the diocese of Norwich.
1 am not certain how far this arrangement has been carried out.

(²) As the tural Beana, wherever they existed, were the consessores naen· of their maurita, the
following injunction of the synod of Ely (AD. nnxxv111.)shews that there were no 'fleam at that
time. ‘¹ Item eodem die nominati suerunt poenitentiarii in singulis Uttanatibus Comitum Canta-
briyiensis, quibus concedi posset facultas absolvendi n‘n casibus episeopo reservatis per literas
speciales domini episcopi.”-CC. M. B. et H. Vol. 111. p. 713.
