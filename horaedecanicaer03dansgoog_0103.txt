the constitutions of John Thoresby, archbiss10p of York
(AD. meconion), so often abufing their privilege by the ξ
sale of their judicial character to inferior and diffionest ξ
substitutes — “ etiam immoderate nonnunquam notabili l

A curious question ensues in the Provinciale— fflffidtoff {2⁰}

“ Whether the Beana of the archbiffiop's peculiarS, as ‘nm-{fem v.
Shoreham‚ Croydon, and othem, can, ece cory‘uetudine {mm ⁰ Μ’

which the author responds in the affirmative ;—because,
says he, those Utens have archidiaconal jurisdiction “ in

deputes them: “ Cum tamen coeteri Bataui rurales, etiam

Whatever capacity of sitting judicially on mtrimonicd ¹
causes, in toutt-betissttan, ozans tutal may have had before

retained it after its commencement: though Bishop PachhialAnti-
Kennett is of opinion that the twenty-third Constitution lgf‘is‘issf’ v⁰¹'¹¹‘
of Cardinal Otho, already referred to, allows them to ᾗ

retain their jurisdiction in these matterS, provided they 1

could allege privilege ‘01²v custom for the same. But,
without at all regarding the annotations of the gloffator,
to which the bi1hop objects on the score of preju-
dice and partiality, I am inclined to interpret the term

“muni'’ of the text (“fi qui vero finani, archidiaconi, vel
