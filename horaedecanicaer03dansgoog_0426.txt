Antiquitieat, hath affirmed‚ that this institution was peculial· to Germany, Gaul, Great
Britain, and the northern parts of Europe ; but altogether unknown to Italy, till the
time of Cardinal Borromeo. The ground of that error was, a false notion enter·
tained by him, that the bean tutal in the church answered to the unaing-man in the

state, and had the same extent ‘ff juv-indiction (so he speaks); which led him to
imagine, that that portion of a bishoprick which we call a tuta! beant& was to be
found in no countries but where the like civil distribution into eithinys prevailed. 1
need oppose nothing to this opinion beyond the authority os Sir H. Spelman, in tbat
part of his glossary which he himself printed3 where he tells us, that the tuta! braum
answered (not ιο the secular tithing, but rather and more nearly) to the county
hundred.

“ ”uenatus dicitur de portione episcopatds, centuria seu hundredo comitatae
respondenti, et betam olim suppositd.” Glossar. in voce betanstuz, p. 166.

That there were tuta! beans bere in the Saxon times Ι doubt not3 though the
histories and ecclesiastical monuments of those ages, now preserved, are silent con-
cerning them. The only instance of this kind produced (p. 633) by the writer just
now mentioned, is no sure proof of it; being taken from that part of Edward the
Confessor's laws which is not looked upon as genuine, but thought to be added to
them by Henry 1., who restored and enforced them.

Not long after the reign of Henry Ι. these officers are mentioned in the great
Lateran Comen, held AD. uotum, under the title of metant constituti sub Archi-
diaconis ,· and rules are prescribed for lessening the expences that attend their visita·
tions. From that time our English ecclesiastieal laws take frequent notice of them.
The true reasons of the first rise and institution os this office were, the great extent
of dioceses and archdeaconries, and the necessity which bishops were under of
attending not only at ecclesiastical synode, but all great councils of state; and the
share they had (especially aster the time of Charles the Great) in the management of
public offices and affairs. This occasioned a delegation of all their jurisdiction to
some Officers, and of some parts of it to others erected for this purpose; from whom
they preserved a right of appeal. As to the particular erection of beans rutel, 1 mn-
not better account for it than in the excellent words of Roverius, a French author of
note.

“Cum ad presbyteros rure deqentes extendere se continu& non posset episcoporum
aut archidiaconorum viyilantia, collocati fuere per intervalla in quibusdam quasi
excubiis presbyterorum aliqui, uetant vel attbipttssbptttt vocitati, ut coeterorum pres-
byterorum et plebis moribus, vice episcopi aut archidiaconi, inviqilarent.”

What Roverius says of their officiating in France ‘⁸ vice episcopi aut archidiacon&
is confirmed, as to England, by Lynwood, in various parts of his Provincial. In one
place he calls them “vicarii episcoporum quam archidiaconorum-’³ In a third, he
says that they are ‘⁶ uetant temporales ad aliquod ministerium sub episcopo vel archi·
diacono exercendum constituti.’' In a fourth, he thus describes them 2-“ Sunt per·
