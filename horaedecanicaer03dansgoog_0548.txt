In a foot-note I have subjoined, a curious document, entitled the collation of a¹
corbanan or hctauatoe, ΑΒ. Mocccw„ within this diocese. It is extracted from the

Glossary of Sir Hem-y Spelman. (See also diocese of Armagh.)

In the registry-office of the see ofDerry there is no record whatever connected with
the subject of my inquiry. The Rev. Dr. Boyton has kindly examined all the Visita-

appear to have been first distributed to these offices throughout the diocese. But
though there are no records of the office, it is stated, on competent authority, that the
present archbishop of Armagh, when Bishop of Raphoe‚ revived the office during his
episcopate3 and his successor, Bishop Magee, continued it. Since the translation of
the latter, 1 believe, there has been no interruption to the appointment. The admi—

sends to each tuta! bran, annually, copies of a list of quer-ies, of which the latter
forwards one to each incumbent in his henum. The answers to the quer-ies are some-
times filled up by the incumbent himself, and sometimes by the bean on the incum-
bent’s report, subject of course to the former’s correction, whenever he personally
visits. The papers, when filled up, are sent back to the bishop, and are opened
formally at the visitation, as each incumbent’s name is called. This is the official
