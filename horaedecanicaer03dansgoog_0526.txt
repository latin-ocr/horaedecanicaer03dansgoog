Having seen in the public journals (Feb. 17. uncccxxx1v.), that “the bishop of
worcester (Carr) had, with his accustomed solicitude for the welfare and good regu-
lation of his diocese, determined on reviving in the various brandea within bis
jurisdiction in worcestershire and Warwickshire the ancient office of tuta! bean,
which had been discontinued in the diocese sor nearly a century,’' Ι applied to his
lordship for the forms used on that occasion; and have pleasure in laying them
before the reader. Mr. Clifton, the deputy registrar‚ has communicated, by command
of the bishop, a copy of the instrument ofappointment, and likewise of the questions
propounded by the heau tuta! to the clergy of each twenty.

Bishop Pepys informs me (Oct. 2. mncccxm11.), that the tuti-hetam! administration
of his diocese remeius upon the same footing, with the same commission and Articles
<ff Inquit-y, as in the days of Bishop Carr. Finding that the plan, as then adopted,
worked well, his lordship has not thought fit to make any change in it; although be
is of opinion that the reports of the tuta! beans should be made to the archdeacon and
not to the bishop; and any directions to the churchwardens required thereby should
be issued by the former, viz. the archdeacon. ⁴ As yet, however, no change has been
deemed expedient in the wording of the commission, or its application to parochial
visitation.

decent abode, that you deliver‚ in writing under your hand, tothe minister and cburch-
wardens in each parish, an order specifying the things which you shall judge necessary
