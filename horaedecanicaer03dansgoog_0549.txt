siastical matters. The archbishop of the province visits once in three years, and the
bishop of the see the other two; the archdeacon not at all. An effort is being made,
I am told, to revive tura! thapttts in this diocese, and I sincerely hope it may be
successful. Something of the kind seems to be essentially necessary in Ireland
generally, in order to enable the parochial clergy, scattered and dismembered as they
are, ιο acquire that collective strength and influence so necessary for them to com-
pete with the well-disciplined organization of the Romanists, and the democratic
organization of the Presbyterians and others.

The Rev. Dr. Boyton has supplied me with the Viennam-queri& of the diocese of
Raphoe for the years mnoccxxvr--vr1-·1x--xxxv·-v111--x1.1.—of Derry for Mncccxxxvr.
—and Der-ry and Raphoe for Mocccxxxlx. and moccxnn. The most important of
these documents are annexed. The others differ only in some few particulars. The
earlier ones have the sig-nature of the archbishop of Armagh‚ having been used at his
triennial visitationm the later, that of the bishop of Derry, or of the bishop of Derry
and Raphoe. The articles of inquines for the year mnoccxu1. indicate an earnest
desire on the part of the bishop to render the Utens as useful as possible in supplying·
him with information as to the state of his diocese in the rural districts. If the
quer-ies are received in the spirit with which they are dictated, and are fully and
conscientiously responded to in practice, they must tend essentially to preserve the
discipline of the church. There are at present six tuta! beans in Dea-y, and five in
Raphoe, according to Robertson's Clerical Regisler for the year Mucccxmv.
