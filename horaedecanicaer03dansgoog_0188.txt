The Lower Houfi· have considered the amendments sent down by your
Lordships, relating to the paper about tutal baum and cannot agree to
the two first of those amendments. The reasons of their disagreernent

are contained in the following paper: (May 502, mnccxl.)

May it please your Lordstzips—

The fourth paragraph of the paper relating to tuta! bans, as sent up
by the Lower Houfie to your Lordships, contained the following clause:
“ Unless great cause mall appear to the biihops and archdeacons having
jurisdictioni, or to the biffiop where there is no archdeacon with jurisdic-

Ι tion, for displacing them sooner-’⁸

ᾗ This clause your Lordstzips propose ssiould be thus amended: ‘⁶ Unless
f cause shall appear to the biihops for displacing them sooner.'’

To this amendment the Lower Houfi disagrees, for the following
ff reasons :—
3 lst. Butal Blavia, by the nature and duty of their office, are ministeriaL
t both to the bissiop and archdeacon3 and your Lordstzips have been
Ξ pleased to agree, that they ssmll be appointed by both jointly; and the
clergy do humbly conceive that the same reason will equally hold for
the displacing of them by both jointly.

2d. What is conceived to be thus reasonable in itseli', is expreffly
‘enjoined and determined in the body of the canon-law, under the title
‘⁸ De officio archidiaconi;” which chapter is a decretal epistle of Inno-
cent the Third, and contains as follows :—“ Subseqnemkrss’ etc.
t 3d. That no doubt may remain whether the soregoing decretal epistle,
¹and particularly this clause os it, was received in England‚ the same
ἐ rule of placing and displacing rutal bnans by the bissmp and archdeacon
{jointly‚ is laid down by Athon and Lynwode, in their several commen-
* tan-ies upon the Legatine and Provincial Constitutione, and in both with
⁷ express reference to the said decretal epistle. In the Legatine Constitu-
* tion of Otho, intituled, ‘⁸ De VII. SacramenCis,'’ is this clause: “Archi-
