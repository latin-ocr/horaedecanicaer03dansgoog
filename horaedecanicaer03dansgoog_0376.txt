sor each blant& at the archdeacon's visitation. 1 am not quite sure whether this
custom prevails in both archdeaconries—-Winchester and Surrey; but of the latter
Ι can speak positively. The rural clergy there annually elect from among their own
body a tutal bean, whose business it is to preach at the two ensuing visitations of the
arehdeacon and bishop's commissary. This officer is understood of old to have had
the supervision ofchurches, and to have exercised the other functions of a parochial
visitor. But these useful branches of duty have long since left him. His office is
now-a-days so complete a nullity (save in respect of preaching), that Bishop Sumner,
on his succession to the see, thought fit to establish the new and more efficient order
of officers (under the same name and title), whose appointment is annexed. The
latter, it is expressly provided, is in no way to affect the integrity of the elder insti·
tution; which remains in the same antiquated condition as before.

The new appointment belongs to the personal jurisdiction of the diocesan, and is
held durante episcopi beneplacita—Sea the Commission following: for which Ι am
beholden ιο the venerable C. J. Hoare, archdeacon of winchester.

The islands of Guernsey and J ersey, with their appendages, were heretofore tuta!
Deam-'its of the diocese of Coutances in the dukedom of Normandy‚ and were annexed
to the See of Winchester in the sixteenth century. See {Dora Ξεεαῐιίεα Rutula,
Part lv, Sect. ιι.. and numerous extracts sparslm in our preceding pages. It is pro-
bable that the office of bean tuta! was of very early institution in these maglo-Gallie
isles; for we find it distinetly set forth in the Councils of Rouen, that beans ruta!
exereised jurisdiction in Normandy before the Duke of Normandy, in the person of
William 1.‚ became king of England.—See CC. Rotomay. Provinc. Part 1.

‘⁸ The bishops of Dol and Costtance‚’' says Falle, “ for the exercise of their
authority, had, in each island os Jersey and Guemsey, a mmmm-tam or surressit,
called betanuss, the beant—an office of great antiquity, since 1 find it mentioned in
very old records, and have reason to believe it as ancient as episcopacy‚ and conse-
quently as ancient as Christianity itself, in these islands. To him those bishops lest
the cognizance of all matters of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, reserving only to themselves
ordinations, institutionS, and appeals. The same power is vested in the present
beans, with this limitation, that they are to govern themselves by the advice and
opinions of the rest of the minister5‚ who are to be their constant assessors, much
after the manner of those ancient presbyteries‚ or councils of priests, who sate with
the bishops in their consistories, and assisted them in giving judgment in all causes
brought before them ;—an excellent government, ¹and grounded on the primitive
pattern. When the office of bean was revived in Jersey in the reign of King
James 1.. a motion was made to give the said bean the power of a bisbop §ufftagan
within the island; appeals being still reserved to the Right Rev. Father in God
the Lord Bishop of Winchester. 1 could never know why that motion was rejected.
But we daily see the necessity of such a power, particularly in the want of confir-
mation of children after baptism; that apostolical institution being thereby become
