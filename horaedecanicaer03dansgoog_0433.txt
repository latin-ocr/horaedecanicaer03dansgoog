make true presentments of such defects as you shall find therein, and also the defects
of books, ornaments, and other utensils and furniture, belonging to each church or
chapel: you shall, either by yourself or deputy, faithfully execute, or cause ιο be
executed, all such processes and mandates as shall be sent to you from your ordinary,
and make true returns of the same—So help you God.'’

The benefits raeulting from the execution of this ancient office have of late years
been so sels-evident and important, within the archdeaconry of Cornwall, that every
endeavour to assist the butu rutal, in the discharge of his duty, may serve to encou-
rage a perseverance in so useful an office; and tend to relieve parishes and incum-
bents from very heavy burthenS, to which they are frequently subject, by the neglect
of those necessary repairs to churches and glebe·houses which an annual visitation
and report of the bean tuta! might prevent. With this view, it has been thought

proper to suggest the following regulations for the government of all parties con-
cerned‚ and by which much trouble and time may be saved.

The bean tutal, being elected at the archdeacon’s visitations, will be immediately
sworn into office3 but should he not be present when elected, he should, within a
fortnight of that time, apply ιο the official, or a surrogate of the archdeacon, for that
purpose. He will receive with these instructions a book of printed forms; on which
he will write off his presentments, after he has visited the respective parishcs in the
braum, observing the directions at the end of the book: he will set his name to the
presentments of each parish, in order to render them authentic. He will also receive
with the blank book of formS, a copy of the book of presentments of his last prede-
caeson by which he will see what was presented by the latter; and by taking this
book with him, when he goes to visit the churches, he will be able to ascertain what
steps have been taken to remove the former presentments, and to make his own
accordingly. The churchwardens will be furnished‚ from the registry-office, with a
copy of the Dtanssttttal'ss presentments, as sar as respects their own parish, made out
on a sheet of paper printed on a form corresponding with the bean-tutal's book3 on
which they will be required to make a return ιο the archdeacon, at the next visitation,
of what has been done in consequence of such presentments, and for which they will
have nearly the whole year before them. They cannot, therefore, have the same
excuse that the churchwardens going out of office heretosore had, ‘⁶ that there was
not sufficient time between the beau tutal’s visiting, and the archdeacon's visitation,
for doing the repairs, &c.’' And as they then went out of office, and their successors
did not consider themselves obliged to attend to the directions given by the bean ruta!
to the preceding churchwardens, little or nothing was done. It is to be observed, Δ
that by this scheme there will be an entire alteration of the former practice, for
instffld of the presentments being given in charge ιο the churchwardens qoinq out of
office, the copy will be delivered over to the new churchwardens, at one visitation,

and at the next must be returned to the court, who will examine the churchwardens,
