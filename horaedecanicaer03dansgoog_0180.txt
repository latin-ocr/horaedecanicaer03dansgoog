{io-slgluffffssrg' being urged upon the objectionable plea of prophesy,„

⁰4³⁰1fflsm- {says the nameless author os A Humble Propqsal for
Ξτζέἶέἒὲἐῗξ Parocln'al Reformation, “it is probable, sor that very
1212-26743· ⁸ reason was denied3 seeing it was not advanced upon the

ᾗ constitutions of the church‚ which enjoin not prophesy‚

ᾗ but affistance to the bishops in the government of the

Ι church.”

l Had the proposal originated in a less suspicious

successor of James—at least, not in documents of the
Church of England—though the flxth clause os King
Charles’s Instmctions to Archbssmp Laud (A. D. Mncxxxm),
