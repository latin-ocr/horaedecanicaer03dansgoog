Saint Alban’s, Essa, and Colchester. The tuta! hianti& are hereafter enume-
rated. Bishop Blomfield has recently revived the ancient use of tuta! brana in the
diocese.

The office had been long extinct3 but, at what particular time it became so, I am
uninformed. It existed in the days of Bishop Compton (circiter A. D. uncnxxxix.)
as the annexed Commission and Imtrucliom, kindly supplied by Bishop Blomfield,
sufficiently demonstrate. The commissio pro betunia ruralibus appears llere in
print for the first time. The Imlructiom for the beans tuta! have been before
published, in the Appendiz to Gibson’s C. Ι. Ε. Α., Sect. xv. c. x1x. p. 1550. No
earlier documenta connected with the tuti-numm office in the see of London have
fallen in my way; and, 1 am informed by the learned prelate, who now presides
over it with so much honour to himself and so much advantage ιο the spiritual
interests of the diocese, no others exist in the registry. Indeed, an accurate search,
prosecuted by order os Bishop Blomfield, with a view ιο the present publication, has
led to the conviction. that the office of heau tuta! was not instituted in the diocaee
of London till the seventeenth century.

Among the archives of the Registry is a Iaetter¹ addressed by the Privy Council to

the bishop of London in the year unum„ requiring him to sig-nify the extent of his
diocese, and of what districts or divisions it consisted, together with the several eccle-
siastical promotione within it. And his Lordship‚ in his answer to that Letter,
certifie& that three of the archdeaconries were then divided into beandos by name,
but that there had been no beans within the memory of man: and further (after

surrey, all now in the diocese of Rochester 3-of the borough of Southwark, and the parishes
of Battersea, Bermondsey, Camberwell‚ Christchurch, clepham, Lambeth, Rotherhithe, Str-estham,
Tooting, Graveney, Wandsworth, Merton, Kew, and Richmond, in the county of Surrey, and
present diocese of winchester 3—and of the parishes of Saint Mary Newington, Barnes, Putney,
Mortlake, and Wimbledon, in the county of Surrey, and in the peculiar jurisdiction of the arch·
bishop of Canterbury; together with all extra-parochial places locally situate within the limits
οἰ the parishes above enumerated; except the district of Lambeth-palace.

“ In arranging the diocese of London, our great obJect,” say the Commissioners (Fir-st
Report, ΑΒ. nncccxxxv.), “has been, to bring under the jurisdiction of the same bishop the
metropolis and the suburban parishes; and, in assigning the boundaries of the diocese, we have
adopted those fixed by an Act passed in the fourth and fifth years οἰ your Majesty's reign, ss
comprising the metropolitan district.

‘⁸ In consideration of the great additional population which will then be placed under the
superintendence of the bishop of London, we bave thought it right to relieve that diocese from
the whole county of Hertford, and from those parts of the county of Essex which are not included
within the new limits.'’
