Εοεῖἱιε, and confirmed by the generall council of Chalcedon, Can. 1. But γ’ mention
there made of y‘ tbottpisstopi is not such, as if they had bin there first instituted¹;
but that canon was fram’d‚ to restraine the chorepiscopi from some intrenchm‘' on γ’
episcopall function; w‘¹² must needs inferre, that they had their place in the church
long before= for the invasion of other men’s rights is usuallie the practise of those,

who have gain’d some reputation in the world; to obtaine w‘h, we know, is the work
of time.

Now that the thottpiscopi were ordain'd for ease of the bishops under that soli-
citude, that must needs increase dailie, as did the number of beleevers, appear& by
the fourteenth Can. of the councill of Neocaesarea², held in γ’ yeer of Xt. cocxn..

wherin it is expresslie said, the ΧΩΡΕΠῙΣΚΟΠΟΙ were instituted εἷς τύπον rei-iv ἑβδο-

μήκοντα after y‘ form or exemple of the seventy Disciples, which are commonly
esteem'd to have bin soe menie συλλειτουργοὶ, or assistente of γ’ Η. Apostles. So
Raban⁸ Maurus, &bottpisstopi (saith he) vicarii sunt episcoporum ad exemplum ¹70
seniorum aptati ‚· nec aliq‘* eis licet in 8σοῖἰά ordinare aul constituere, nisi quantum
eis concedit' ἂ legitimis episcopis, qui sedem et reyimen integrum in eccTt'is obtinenst

But as for that part of γ’ episcopall function w‘¹¹ was comitted to their trust, it seemes

the privileges of their superiors, the urban bishops, on pain of deprivation. C. C. E. U. in

(²) The council of Neocaesarea, in Pontus, celebrated according to Hermsnt's Clanis, AB.
cccxiv„ and certainly not Ister than cccxv. in the opinion of Bishop Beveridge, is, by Ruelius
and Hartmsnnus (Cenoma sumtu-ata, Tom. 1. p. 1117) fixed et A.D. cccxvx„ the date specified
by Dr. Priaulx. As to the distribution and number of the canons of this eouncil, there is again
some difference among the learned. By dividing csnon ¹111. (in the Codes Can. Ecol. Unio.)
into two, the common reckoning makes a total amount of fifteen canons in the Neocaesarean
council; of which, the one alluded to is numerically the fourteentht—oi δὲ ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΙ
εἶσὶ μὶν εἷς en'aeor ‹3- Ιβῖομᾶκσκι· ὦς ἷὶ ‘valum-weyt} 3ιᾶ τὸν «ουδὲ, τὴν εἷς τοὺς ττοχσῦς τςκφίςονσι
τιμόμιηι. But the venei-able editor of the Reliquias Sacra, supported by s strong phalanx of
authorities, unites the latter clause on ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΙ to the preceding on Ιτιχάςιω «cumaea,
considering them, instead of distinct canons, to be members of one and the same canon, vis. the
thirteenth r—whereby the aggregate number is reduced to fourteen. See Bm. I. C. V. Tom. 1.

(³) “ Ordinaea' sunt autem tbortpiztopi,” continues the archbishop of Mentz, ‘⁴ propter paupe-
rum curam, qm· in ayt-is et villis consistunt, ne eie solatium confirmationis deesset.’' But when
he says they are called ‘⁶ chorepiscopi, quia de choro sunt sacerdotnm? we may be allowed to
doubt—De Imt. Cler. L. 1. c. 5. Ε. See Meursii Glossar. p. 630 ; Ducsnge Gloss. in voce, and

other references beyond, at p. 454, note l. The Gemma Am'mae de Sacerdotibus hos been adduced
