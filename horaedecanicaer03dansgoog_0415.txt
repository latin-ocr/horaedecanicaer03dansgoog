But there is one other benefit, as to which I cannot be silent, and which, without
appearing eminently in any portion, promises to prevail throughout the scheme,
giving grace and brightness to the whole; namely, a strong tendency to a more
perfect union of counsels and of action among the different members of our ministry‚
in some measure supplying· a want in the English Church, unknown to its early
history, and almost peculiar to it now3 Ι mean, that of petiubital ambli& and
spuens, and of the co-operation which they are calculated to produce. I am not,
indeed, prepared ιο say that our ancient system of convocatione could be revived with
advantage in the present temper of the public mind, or that it would be the best
remedy for the evils under which we labour· . but sure I am that there never was
a moment in the history of our church, when the advantage of brotherly counsels
amongst its ministers was more needed. No one can be insensible to the difficulties
which surround our establishment at the present moment; and few will deny that
there is sufficient learning and piety amongst her minister-s to cope with and over-
come thema of zeal, too, there is abundance, and of discoursers and contemplative
students not a few. What is most wanting is a more cordial union and a more per-
fect understanding among the members of the ministry‚ in order that its energies may
be brought to bear with undivided force upon the body of the church3 and not only
upon the church, but also upon those who have wandered or been led astray from it.
It is a painful fact, that the clergy of our establishment, though labouring earnestly
each in his own field of duty, know less of each other and consult less together for
the common interest of the ministry‚ than any other in the whole world. The fault,
however, is not so much a defect of disposition sor union, as the absence of all occa-
sions and opportunities of cultivating it. They have no general meetings, except at
visitations, when they corne together to hear, and not to communicate with each
other: and were it not sor the advantages and superiorities which they possess in
many respect& and, above all, in the scriptural and apostolical character of their order,
there would be great reason to apprehend that they might sometimes fail in their
conflicts with· other sects, who so well understand the advantage of concerted and
united efforts, and are always found to apply them skilfully in tfiei'r opposition to the
church.

Nor is it merely the loss of union and collective strength that is the effect of our
isolated labours and sectional speculations. The clergy are sometimes associated in
each other’s minds with some opinions of little consequence on which they differ, or

with some local and conflicting interest-s by which they have been disturbed, rather

than with those great and healing principles and truths which lie tranquilly ιιι the
bosoms of the great body of them, to be called forth only' ιιι momenta of confidence
and affection. Τὶιο consequence is, that, when they do meet on ordinary occasions,
they either shrink involuntarily from each other, or are occupied with matters
calculated to repel rather than conciliate. Thus, estimable men, well entitled to each
other's regards, come together, only to separate without any advancement of Christian
