of those persons who with good intentions entered on that desirable work, however
unqualified they might be for it. But, when we consider who have encouraged it
most, and been most employed in it, we may be allowed to suspect, that one end
which some men have had in carrying it on, was to take the inspection of manners
out of their hands to whom it most properly belongs3 and by that means to render
uae sanction as useless as they could, in order to its becoming contemptible.

This, indeed, together with many other steps taken to the same purpose, not
necessary here to be repeated, gives us no very comfortable prospect of procuring
any enlm-gement of the powers we already possess in matters appertaining to reli-
gion and virtue, or of retrieving any of those we have lost. However, some favour-
able juncture may arise, when our superiors in church and state shall lay these
matters to heart‚ and think them worthy of their most serious and wise consideration.
And sure 1 am, that, if ever a re-establishment of church-discipline in its vigour be
sincerely intended, one, and a chief, method of promoting it must be by a restoration
of tuta! bnans aab tbaptttffl, to the full extent of their ancient powers.

Let us join in common wishes for this; and not forget, in the mean time, to exert
the powers of which we are indubitably possessed. The office of bean ruta! is still a
great trust, as it carries with it the care of the church fabrick and utensils, of pre-
venting dilapidations, and of inspecting the manners of the clergy. These parti-
culars are expressly included in his present oath3 the conscientious observance of
which is a matter of great consequence ς and therefore the choioe of such persons as
are to discharge these duties ought not to be neglected or eluded.

And when they are chosen, it were to be wished that they would, as soon after-
war-ds as conveniently they can, set about the work, without deferring it, as they too
often dc, to the very time of the expiration of their office3 when they have neither
leisure nor inclination to make due inquiries, or at least due praeentments upon
them; bnt satisfy themselves with the promises of the respective persons, incum-
bents, to set things right, without having time left sufficient to obliye them to perform
those promises; which are made again, perhapS, to the next bean rutel, towards the
close of his office als0, with as little effect as they were to the former3 and thus dila·
pidations and the decays os churches increase without end and without remedy.

The canon of unnxxr. does, as we have heard, mention preackiny, as one part of
the heau-tuta& business. I will not say that it certainly meant the Visitation Ser-
mom. However, though this be not provided for specially by canon, yet the power
of the ordinary, confirmed by custom‚ bath made it binding. And, 1 hope, it will be
looked upon by those of my brethren who have a right sense of this matter, rather as
an honour than a burthcn. ⁴
1 am sensible 1 have detained you long; and yet there is somewhat still behind,
