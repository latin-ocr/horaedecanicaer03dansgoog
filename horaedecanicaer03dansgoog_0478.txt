visitation is no less difficult for the archdeacon, than it is for the bishop. A personal
inspection of all the churches, chancels, and glebe-houses, throughout this diocese, if
conducted with minute attention to the state of soundness and decay, in the various
materiale of the respective buildings, to the condition of the sacred utensils and vest-
ments, to existing abuses, or neglecte on the part of those to whom the care of such
things is entrusted‚ could not be duly performed by one person in the course of a
whole year. And when, after all that employment of time and attention, the defi-
ciencies have been discovered, which are too often observable, when a parochial visi-
tation is holden sor the first time, there still remains the important duty of seeing
that the defects are duly remedied. For this purpose, a second, and even a third
parochial visitation may be required. And how can a service be in this manner
repeated, when even the first performance of it, if duly executed, would be attended

with so much difficulty and inconvenience P
“ For these reasons Ι have revived in this diocese, as 1 did in the diocese of Llandaff,

the ancient order of tuta! Utam- And Ι take the first public opportunity, which has

. presented itself. since my primary visitation‚ of explaining the motivae which have led

to the appointment of tutal utana in this diocese. Ι am anxious to guard against an
inference, which might otherwise be drawn from it. The appointment of tuta! beans
implies no previous neglect of duty. 1 have reason to be thankful sor the uniform
support which 1 have received from the archdeacon of this diocese. Ι have only
relieved him from a trust, which, from its very maym'tude, requires more exertion,
than can be expected from any one man, however active and labourious.

‘⁶ Even the division of the diocese into maurita, if only one htatt had been
appointed to each huam, would not have afforded sufficient advantages for the
purpose of parochial visitation. Though the limits therefore of the ancient maurita
have been retained, the maurita themselves have been divided into two, three, or four
parts, according to their magnitude3 and a tuta! bean has been appointed for each
division. Without transgressing the limits of the mantin, it was impossible to assign
an equal number of parishes to every division. But, in general, they vary only from
ten to fifteen. The divisione and the appointments have likewise been so arranged,
that the tuta! beans, though they amount to twenty-six throughout the diocese, reside
each of them within the division to which they are appointed. The parishes, there-
fore, which are subjected to their inspection, are all within an easy distance from their
own homes.

“ Having described the plan, 1 will now relate the beneflcial effects, which have
resulted from it. In the first place, a mass os information has been obtained
respecting the state of the diocese, such as never could have been obtained by any
other means. The answers of the tuta! bnans, in the schedule of quer-ies proposed to
them, describe the state of the churches, with particular reference to the walls, the
roof, the pavement, the windows and doors, the pulpit and desk, the font, the petra,
the bells, and the various articles which are necessary for Divine Sel-vice. They
