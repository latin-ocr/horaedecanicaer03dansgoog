Dr. Ledwick, in his Auliquilies qf Ireland, aster quoting· Bishop Rochfort's Con·
stitutions, makes the following remarks :—

“ Here we have a full and clear development of the state of our ancient hierarchy,
and a confirmation of what has been delivered. Ireland was full of thottpisstopi,
billage or tuta! blssbops. In Meath¹ were Clonard‚ Duleek, Kells, Trim, Ardbraccan,
Dunshaughlin, Slane, Foure, Skrine, Mullingar, Loughseedy, Athunry, Ardnurchor‚
and Ballyloughort. In Dublin were SwordS, Lusk‚ Finglas, Newcastle‚ Tawney,
Salmon-leap or Leixlip. Bray, Wicklow, Arklow, Ballymore, Clondalkin, Tallaght,
and O’Murthy, which included the ruta! mantin of Castledermot and Athy. These
were all ruta! ῢῑεατίεβ, and of course τατειῖ βαΰ, before the year 1152: however, the
transmutation of one into the other proceeded slowly; for by Bishop Rochsort’s
Constitutione, before, we find it was far from being completed in the lsth century. 1f
the number of tuta! ῦωατίεβ at their first erection, and afterwards, in consequence of
Paparo’s regulation, could be discovered from records in the Vatican or elsewhere, it
would give us the number of our tuta! stez. The tura! heaut-tes in the common
diocesan reg-isters are not correct, or Ι might easily have adduced them. Our bishops,
I suppose, might have amounted to above 300. Our ignorant² legendary writers, to
account for this number, had recourse to the fable of St. Patrick's ordaining three
hundred and fifty or sixty·five.'' .

In primate Marsh’s library, St. Patrick’s, Dublin, there are, Dr. Travers tells me,
two Vuilation-boolcs; one by Bishop Usher, in uncxxn.. the other by Bishop Dop-
ping, in uncxcv.; in both of which the diocese is said to consist of twelve manticis:
but there is nothing to indicate that the τατειῖ bean exercised any jurisdiction at either
of those dates.

Ι am in possession of a very rare little book, published, A.D. Mncxcvr„ by Bishop
Dopping, entitled, Tractatus de Visitationibus Episcopalibus, in which beans tuta! are
frequently mentioned; but fr0m the way in which their proeentments are alluded to
(p. 17), and contrasted with the less perfect discipline of charchwardens and sidesmen
in his days, it seems as if beans ruta! were not then in the exercise of their functions,
or, at least, of this part os them.⁸
