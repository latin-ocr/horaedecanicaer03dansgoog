But beans do not seem to have been generally revived at that time, in the other
archdeaconrioe. In Berkshire, none are mentioned; and in Wiltshire only two, viz.
in the tutal mantica of Pottern and Marlborough3 in both of which the dignities
were profitlesS, as appears from the following catrico—‘⁶ Decumum de Pottern’.

With the separation of the county of Dorset from the diocese of Sarum we again
lose sight of the institution. For one hundred and thirty years there is no trace of
it in the parent see3—none, that is, till the episcopate of Seth Ward, who was
installed in the year uncnxvr„ and shortly aster revived the ancient use of tutal
beans in the archdeaconries of Sarum, wilts, and Berks.

Mr. Boucher, the late registrar of the diocese, is inclined to doubt whether this
commission of the Beana rutal was ever put in execution by the eminent disciplina-
rian adverted to :—“ The excellent and charitable Bishop Ward,” he observes, in a
letter lately received, “took an active part in the exercise of his episcopal functions
in the diocese of Sarum (ΑΙ). uncnxv1.—nncr.xxxvm.), as he had previously done
in that of Exeter, and certainly appointed tutal Beuum and, at the same time, issued
his mandate for the visitation of his cathedral church, viz. of the canons, vicars-choral,
and other officers of the church, and of certain hospitaIS, which had formerly taken
place septennially. But it appears», from the records of the chapter, that the latter
mandate exceeded his lordship’s authority, and was in part recalled. And as there
is no evidence of any return having been made by the tuta! blant-⁵, which the
registers would have shewn if such had been the case, it is supposed, with some
reason, that their commission was not put in execution.'’

Highly as 1 estimate the general accuracy of my much-respected informant upon
all matters connected with the office which he so long and so ably filled, I cannot go
with him to this conclusion. There doubtless exist no returns by the functionaries
alluded ιο, in the archives of the registry·office; and so far Mr. Boucher is right.
But, in my humble opinion, the inferenee he draws, from the non-appearance of any
such returns, is incorrect. It must not be inferred from the absence of such docu-
ments that the officers never acted under their commission: we know that they did
so act: and if there were no direct evidence of the fact, I should still doubt the
tuti-hetanal institution, in the hands of such a prelate as Seth Ward, turning out a
failure. 1 should doubt his attempting (with his eyes open to the constitution of the
office in yeneral, and in his own diocoee in particular), an appointment‚ which he

had not power to consummate to any useful purpose.
