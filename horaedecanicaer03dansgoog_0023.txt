Indeed, from an earlier notice of them in the works
of the same metropolitan, it would appear that these*
monthly tnngttgatinns of the Rhemiih clergy had beenx
long enough establiffied, at that period, to degenerate Α
from their pristine character of deliberative tonhtuttons·
for the good of the church‚ into convivial banquetings
for the sensual gratification of the clergy3 — abuseS,.
which Hincmar endeavoured to remedy‚ by ordering—
“ Ut . . . . post peractum divinum mysterium et necefflzriam ejusdmpffu.
collationem, non quast ad prandium ibi sedeant ad tabulam,
et per tales inconvenientes pastellos Je invicem yravent‚ &c.
Ideo peractis omnibus, qui voluerint, panem cum caritate i
et gratiarum actione, in domo confratris sici stmnl cnm fra-
tribus suis franqant, et stnyulos biberes accipiant, maxime

ad ecclefiassuas redeant.’'

This is one of the first notices I have met with of
ruta! Φερίας abroad3 where the clergy of those early
dayS, though they appear to have congregated monthly
for transacting ecclefiastical affairs, and the performance
of inspectional and correctional duties among them-
selveS, did so without always assuming the imposing type
of a uttanal syn‘oh, or placing an artbpttshyttr in¹ the ὲ
chair. sztmhliez of the latter character were rare s
(though far from such a degree of infrequency, as to Υ
authorise Lyndwood and others in stating them to be

almost peculiar to Great Britain) 3—while menstrua]
