hereafter spoken of) long before Balsamon's time, who lived about ye year of X‘.
ucxc.. and says of these chorepiscopv, y· ὁ τῶν mrsmzxonon βαθμός παντελῶς
ἦπρᾶκτησεν, ad Cone. Aneyr. c. 13., that order was wholie abolisht in y' church: and
in y‘ place thereof we find there succeeded y0 ΠΡΩΊῸΠΛΠΑΣ or IIPnTo'l'EPEYZ', after

from Bithynia: at the council of Ephesus we have Caesarius tbuttpistupus Cappadociae.—Hart-
man. et Ruel. CC. Illuser. Tom. 11. p. 213.

( ι) Balsamon’s words <which the reader will find cited by the learned president of Magdalen,
in his Annon. in Ancyr- Cone. Canu. Reliq. Sacr. Vol. 111. pp. 438·-9) are to be received with
some qualification. Itis true, that in the Bastern cburch the order of billan hisbups rana-“5
oie-edamu- in the patriar-chates of Constantinople and Antioch, but noe in that os Alexandria;
where, on the authority of Petrus de Mares, de concord. Sacerd. L. ιι. c. 14, the chorepiscopi
supplanted the bishops, and enjoyed the sole regimen of the churches under the patriarch. This,
however, was a particular exception; and may not invalidate the ,veneral assertion of the Greek
canonist and commentator in relation to the East. But the case was very different in the West,
where we find, between the time of the suspension of this order in the Greek church and the age
of Balsamon, numerous notices of tbuttputnpt in councils, capitularieS, and papal epistles. See⁸
Epist. Joann. Pap. 111. AD. nux„ SS. CC. Tom. VI. 502. Capitul. Aquisyraem. Carol. M. A.D.
nccsxxxvm„ SS. CC. Tom.1x. col. 23 with many others of the age of Charles the Great and
charles the Bald, in the eoncilia Gallia. Indeed, even the establishment of archdeacous and
&ttbptitsts does not appear to have led to an entire and perpetual suspension of the chorepiscopi
order in the West. So far from it, that in our own country, Dr. Inett supposes (Oriyines Anyti·
cano, Vol. 11. c. 111.) the order was introduced at a comparatively late period, viz. posterior to the
Norman Conquest; our foresathers, doubtless, following the type of ecclesiastical governmenh
which had earlier obtained among their Gallican neighbours. The grade‚ once instituted, long
prevailed in these islands. And, upon the accurate information of Mr. Wharton, it may be
stated, that in the diocese of London, alone, there were no fewer than twenty-eight thunpistnpt
between the years ucccxu. and nnn.. De Episcopi· Londinenn'bus, p. 124. In the diocese of
Sarum, there were twenty-nine, the earliest being A.D. su„ the latest A .D. nnxxxvu.. according
to ΜΓ. Wharton’s Lm os suffragan hisbups in the Lambeth Library. Such readers as are de·
sirous of farther information respecting the ancient tbnttpiztupt. are referred to the following
works (in addition to the well-known authorities of Meursius, Suicer‚ Ducange, Morin, Duaren‚

(²) 'rhat the ΠΡΩΤΟΠΑΠΑΣ succeeded the ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΣ in the East, is expressly affirmed
by Balsamon and Aristenus. The former interprets ΧΩΡΕΠῙΣΚΟΠΟΙ of the eighth canon of
Antioch by ΠΡΩΤΟΠΑΠΑΔΕΣ; and the latter as plainly says, ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟῙ ὶὶ ιῖω 01 cuipam
