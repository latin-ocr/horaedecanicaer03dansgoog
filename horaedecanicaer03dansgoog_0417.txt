all my cordial thanks for the readiness with which you attended my summons‘3 for
the kindness with which you accepted the few words of explanation 1 was then
enabled to submit to you3 and generally for the pains and accuracy with which you
have answered my inquiries. To many of you my special gratitude is due for
information and advice of great advantage in critical matters connected with the
discipline of the church= services they were, grateful to me in their season; but they
are still more pleasing to me in the remembrance, inasmuch as they afford a pledge
of your cordial co-operation in these more important concerns which are now sub·
mitted to you. With great confidence, therefore, I leave them in your hands= and
in furtherance of the same views‚ and to give every facility in my power to your
exertions, 1 have addressed a circular to the clergy in your districts, recommending
them severally to conform to thoee regulations, and to unite with you in the support
of a plan, in which the efficiency of the ordinary, the interests of their several flocks‚
the welsare of the church, and the honour of God, are all concemed.
I am, my Reverend Brethren,
Your faithful Friend,
Jauuary 1840. W. CHICHESTER.
