Archbisnop Peckham, in the fore-cited Corffliwtions of 1
Lambeth (Α. D. Mccnxxxn)—“ for the extirpation of this}
villany from the province’'—“ Ut nullus betanuz. . . . . ,ξ

If any such clandestine and false inquffition was heldi
subsequent to the passing of the statute of prohibition, it f
was farther decreed, that the said inques? should be null ³
and void, and the acts thereos of no obligation3 and, by ·
way of marking the council’s condemnation of all the
parties concerned in the transaction, the Bran, as author
of the same, in the capacity of president of the chapter, ,
was to make restitution and satisfaction for all loffes Ι
sustained by the aggrieved incumbent, and the intruder² ζ
was to be excluded for ever from the benefice on which Ι
he had made the iniquitous aggression, and to be sus· =

pended from all other church preferment for the space j
of three year52. i

(¹) The continuance of this practice of intruston, so late as the days
of Biffiop Bedell‚ three hundred and fifty years aster the Lambeth Ceryli-
latinns, gives us a bad idea of the state of chureii-discipline in Ireland in ff
the seventeenth century. That it prevailed, however, at that time, we ί
have the authority of Biffiop Burnet; who tells us “it was an abuse too
common sor licentious clerks to pretend either that an incumbent was 1
dead, or that he had no right to his benefice, or that he had forfeited it; '¹
and, upon that, to procure a grant of it from the king, and then to turn ἓ

the incumbent out of poffeffion‚ and to vex him with a suit till they had 1
soroed him to compound for his peace.”
