ROBERT, by Diviue permission Lord Bishop of Ossory, to our beloved in Christ,
the reverend in our said diocese, greeting—

Forasmuch as this our diocese of Ossory was heretofore of old divided into tura!
Drumias, or districts, and tuta! beans were appointed thereto, We have thought fit
(the care and good government of the said diocese us thereunto moving) to revive
the said antient constitution. Unto you, therefore, in whose industry and fitness we
greatly confide in the Lord, we grant and commit full power and authority, by these
presents, from time to time, as often as you shall think fit, to visit the several churches

and chapels in that part of the turni beant& of , consisting of the several
parishes of ‚ and to inspect into the state and condition of the said churches

and chapels, and of the churchyards, the communion-plate, pews, vestments, and books,
and all other things necessary for the decent celebration of divine service= likewise to
examine and inquire into the state and condition of the several glebe-houses, offices,

duties, nor the other amend their lives, they were ιο inform the bishop‚ and the bishop was to
proceed against them according ιο law. But the institution has been long laid aside‚ and in this
diocese (Ossory) is only known by the names of the several maurita being still retained on the
Visitation-books. ’

“It fell into the same disuse in England as here; but as the power and jurisdiction of the
archdeacons is there in full force and actual exercise, the deficiency has been the less felt, and
the discipline of the church‚ as far as it was committed to such institutions, suffered the less
materially.

“ Yet, even in England, we find many pious bishops expressing their regret at the disuse of
this office; and some of them succeeded in having it re-established, under new regulations.
Archbishop Secker observes, that the institution took place in England before the Conquest3
that it was kept up till the Great Rebellion3 and was afterwards restored in several dioceses, and
preserved till his days.

‘⁴ The convocation, at one time, made some progress towards its general re·establishment; but
nothing was eompleted; and it has since been lest ιο the zeal and discretion of the several
bishops, how far they may think it eipedient ιο revive, and how to regulata it.

“As the jurisdiction and power of the archdeacon‘s court have fallen into disuse in this
kingdom, this office might be of essential service ιο our discipline. The present archbishop of
Cashel, to whom the church of Ireland isas much indebted as ιο any prelate of modern days, has
got it revived throughout his whole province, under new regulations, perfectly calculated ιο
answer its best purposes.

‘⁸ 'I'he Lord Primste, on his appointment ιο the see of Armagh, not only revived the institution

ixplhis own diocese, but strongly recommends it to his suffragantis· (Sermons and Char-90⁸.
