'nne soregoing articles were accompanied with the following letter, addressed by
the bishop's secretary to each tutal tm e—

“ Rsv. Sua—1 am directed by the lord bishop of Derry to forward to you, as tutal
bean, the accompanyingforms which relate to the several parishes comprised within
your branta. The object for which they are sent, will, of course, be at once apparent
from their contents. But you will not fail to observe, that, on some important points,
these forms have been expanded in detail somewhat more than has hitherto been
usual. His lordship hopes by this means to possess himself of fuller knowledge of
the state of the several parishes within his jurisdiction than is wont to be attained
through the ordinary Articles oflnquiry,· and he looks with confidence to your

. official reports as a further assistance to him towards this end. With this design, he

has directed me to express his earnest desire that your reports should be, as far as
may be possible, grounded on personal inspection‚ and as explicit as you may think
necessary to enable him to ensure the information which he is so anxious to obtain.

united dioceses, Sir J. Ware, I believe, has not noticed. But my kind antiquarian

a later document, entitled the Ledqer, or Tern'er, (AD. uncxrvemncxxx.) divides the
former into six nunties, adding· Claudermont and Mome3 and the latter into five,
adding Manchrimorne and Maglennie Vordburne. In practice, the distribution into
usauria is now acknowledged3 and one of the commissiom, with which Bishop
Mant has kindly supplied me, very properly refers to their existence ‘⁸ heretofore of
old.'’

In the ms. Visitation-book (AD. uocum), entitled, ‘⁶ Tne State ‘ff me Bislwpriclc
os Downe and Connor with the juris-diction and officers,’'courteously entrusted to me
by Dr. Todd, Ι find it stated that ‘⁸ jurisdiction is exercised by virtue of a commission
