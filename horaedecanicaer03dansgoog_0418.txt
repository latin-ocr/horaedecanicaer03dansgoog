vl. That, for the more effectual support of the great church interests above recited‚
for the maintenance of Christian fellowship and union among the members of the
ministry, and especially for a testimony before all men of our relianee upon Almighty
God for aid and success in all our endeavours, a general meeting· of the clergy in

meeting shall be preceded by divine service and a sermon in the church; after which

moting Christian Knowledge²

(¹) This regulation is submitted entirely to the consideration of the clergy, as well respecting
the time and manner of carrying it into effect, as to its practicability. It is not necessary to the
plan, though important, if practicable, to its fun development.

On referring to the Resolutions passed at the last meeting at Brighton‚ you will perceive that
the task of inquiring and reporting respecting the state of schools in each tutal mamm is en-
trusted to the committee of the association, consisting of the laity and clergy resident therein,
who are to meet from time to time, when summoned according to certain prescribed rules; and
it is possible that some doubts may arise whether such meetings are intended to be identical
with those of the tura! thapttts recommended in the present letter. To obviate all misunder-
standing on this s'ubject,1 beg leave to state that the ruta! thamna are totally distinct from
these committees: that the former are purely pastoral and ecclesiastical, their members all
clerical, their duties various, and their meetings fixed and periodical; whereas the members of
the association committees are partly lay and partly clerical‚ and their meetings only occasional,
as circumstances may require. But 33 the state of the schools will always occupy some portion
of the attention of the ruta! thaptttz, it would be right and wise that the two committees, which
will have many members in common, should communicate with each other for the beuefit of
their common object.
