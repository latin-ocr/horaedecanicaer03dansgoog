It is noticed of John Bishop of Glasgow (AD. mcxv), that “ he divided the diocese
into two archdeaconrieS, viz. Glasgow and Teviotdale, and set up the offices of bean
and §ub-bean, &c., in his newly-rebuilt cathedral ;” but there is no mention of any
further sub-division of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Keith’s Cataloyue, p. 232. Ex
Clu-on. Melros. Indeed‚ some say this distribution of the diocese into archdeaconries
did not take place till the episcopate of Bishop William de Bondington (AD.
mccxxx111.-mcct.v11.); and if so, tuta! beant! must have existed before archdeacons.—
Keith’s H. C. p. 239.

From the Glasgow Reyister it appears to have been customary for the tuta! beans
of the diocese, in the thirteenth century. to affix their seals to instruments which ⁸
they witnessed—“ el in hzv’us rei testimonium sigillum meum, et sigilla Domini J. de
Killebride, betani de Valle Clud δια, huic scripto sunt apposita.” (N0. 120.) And
even when they had ceased to exercise their betunal functions sufficient celebrity
seems to have attached to them in respect of their vacated office for them to continue
it as a post-official distinction—‘⁶ Testibus Τ. metans de Carric. merido quondam
metans de Cuningham (obliyatio Domini de Carric. N⁰. 139. A.D. uocum). The
beans of Clydesdale and Lennox are also often witness& at this date.

The nine ruta! usauria of the diocese are mentioned by name in the “ Taoeatt’o be-
neficiorum preter prelacias Scotie in dec-ima parte eorundem armo uocnxxv.”—
“ Encaustus de Peblis—Baetanatus de Tevidaile —Baetauatus de N yeht—mnanatuz de

ssttanatuz de Kyill et Cwnynghame-Bttanatus dc Carrik.'’ Reyist. Gla-sy. p. nx111.;
and the same are again mentioned in a taxation of the sixteenth century, p. Lxxx.

A remarkable instrument entitled “Aet execution of citation of the Bishop of
Glasgow at the instance of the canons '’ by the sstem of OEbrlzttanity (Aa). Mccnxxv.)
is hereafter given in full, and two others are referred to (ι.) Precepts of institution
and Induction by utana ruta! about the same period are also printed entire (11. 111.)

original cathedral of Glasgnw, having been probably for the most part built of wood, was de-
stroyed by fire; and Joscelin founded a Society to collect funds for its restoration, under royal
sanction and protection. Speaking of his church, he says: ⁴⁸ Macer multarum qeneium exilis an-
echas et απρωεα, ad honorem Dei ampliari desiderat. et preterea in hiis diebus nostris ique con-
sumpta ad sm· repas-acionem amplissimis expensis indiyens et nostrum et plurium proborum Ιιο-
