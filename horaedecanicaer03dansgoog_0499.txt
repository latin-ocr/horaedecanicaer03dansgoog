After the Apostles’ times (to omitt w‘ some learned men have conceaved of γ’ order
of presbyters themselves) the first instance of this partition of things belong-ing to
the episcopall function, Ι take to have bin made in the Eastern church, in that degree
of ministers, we* they call’d ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟΠΟΙῙε of whom the first mention we have in
antient councills is that of Ancyra², c. 13, held in the year of Christ cccxm, πώ,
together w²¹¹ four other provinciall synodes⁸, was reoeaved into the Cod. Can. Univers.

 

   
   

when the subject wherein one man’s labours of sundrie kinds are imployed, doth waxe so great,
that the same men are no longer able to manage it sufficiently as before, the most naturall waye
to helpe this is by deviding their charge into slipes, and ordaining of under-officers‚ as our
Saviour under twelve Apostles seaventie presbyters; and the Apostles, by his example, seaven
deacons to be under both.’'—Eooles. Politia, B. v, p. 420.

p. 131; and SS. CC. Tom. xv. eol.534. The signification of the term is better understood by
Suicer than Meursius. ‘⁸ Dicei suere non reqionum aue paroeciarum episeopi,” says the former,

(²) 'rho council of Ancyra, the metropolis of Galatia, first mentions thortpistopi by name,
in its thirteenth canon: mPEmZKonou: psit Ιξσῒνια restam-iesvs a 'antinous zuen-snb, ἇλλὲ μὴν

hisbops are alluded ιο in the Concilium Antiochenam contro Paulum Samosaeenum, A.D. ccnxtx„
under the designation of finalem νῦν iniens ὀγςὸυ, as distinguished from those νῦν rixam.—

(³) The four other provincial synods were those of Neocaesarea, A.D. cccxxv. ς Gangre, AD.
cccxxv.; Antioch, A.D. cccx1.1.; and Laodicea, ΑΒ. ccctxw.; which, with the canons of four
oecumenic councils, Nice, A.D. cccxxv.; Constantinople, A.D. cccnm1.; Ephesus, ΑΙ).

ΕΚΚΑΗΣΙΛΣ of the Bibliotheca Juris canonici of Justellus, Tom. ι. It is to the first canon of
the latter council, held at Chalcedon in Bithynia, that Dr. Priaulx refers, as ratifying and con·
firming the canons of five antecedent provincial synods: πὸς πρὸ οὖν ἁγίων ene-iem ud· iudea-nv

The council of Antioch, twenty-seven years after that of Ancyra, limits the functions of
